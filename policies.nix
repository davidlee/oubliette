# The egress and ingestion policies this host declares. Its own file for the same
# reason as net.nix, targets/ and capsules.nix — several places need these
# values and none of them may spell them twice — and, like all three, a *value*:
# nothing here reads the system or does work.
#
# **A policy is a control, and a control has one owner.** Which project a slot
# holds is semantics: cheap, frequent, delegable, and the thing a fleet exists to
# vary. What that slot may talk to, and what may come back out of it, is not —
# and it lived in `target.nix` until now only because one target made the two
# questions look like one (NOTES item 36, item 25). An assigner selects a policy
# by name from the set its slot declares (capsules.nix) and may not author one;
# a host operator declares the set and never has to spell an allowlist twice.
#
# **Paths, not contents.** Every allowlist stays a plain file outside the store,
# which is what lets it change without a rebuild — the same rule the single
# allowlist has always been kept under. What a policy adds is *which* file.
#
# **One directory, because a hardened unit has to be able to read it.** The
# proxy runs with `ProtectSystem=strict` and an explicit `BindReadOnlyPaths`, and
# the file it reads is chosen at run time by a symlink the `policy` verb
# re-points. Binding one declared directory makes the set of files a proxy could
# ever read bounded and legible, which a per-policy path scattered over the disk
# would not.
#
# `rec`, for one reason: `everything` is the vocabulary's own names, and deriving
# it here is what keeps a slot's permissive declaration one word instead of a
# list that drifts as this file grows.
