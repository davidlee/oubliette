# What a fresh capsule needs before it is a capsule you can work in, beyond its
# history and its static config. `capsule-inject` pushes these over the existing
# ssh channel as you — and `capsule <name> start` runs it, so a started capsule
# has them; `host/inject.nix` is the mechanism and knows none of the below.
#
# Its own file, and deliberately not a target's: none of this is a property of
# the repo under confinement. doctrine has no opinion about which agent you sign
# in as, and a second target would share this list unchanged. Empty is a working
# value — a capsule with no injections is a capsule you log into by hand.
#
# **Selection is the whole point.** Every entry names what leaves this host, and
# the default for anything not named is that it stays. The tempting version —
# copy `~/.claude` in — would carry `projects` (every repo path you have opened),
# `history.jsonl` (3 MB of prompts) and `file-history/` into a jail that exists
# to not have them.
#
# An entry is `{name, dest, produce, tools}` plus an optional `optional`:
#
#   - `produce` is a host-side shell fragment writing the payload to stdout. It
#     is a program, not a value, which is what keeps filenames, formats and key
#     names out of the mechanism. `$capsule` is in scope, so a payload may differ
#     per capsule; argv is not, since the flag loop has already consumed it.
#   - `optional = true` means a source that is not on this host is a skip rather
#     than a failure — the working absent path a declaration shared by every host
#     needs.
#
# The volume's mount point is the only thing taken from `targets/`, because a
# payload's destination is on the volume and `/work` may not be spelled twice.
# Nothing else target-shaped belongs here.

  # The bwrapped agent's home on this host. Not the human's: that one has the
