# Probe: does firecracker come up with its tap inside a network namespace?
# (docs/plan-c-multi-capsule.md, "The last unknown — run, and it holds")
#
# It was the last unknown in the netns shape, and everything downstream of it —
# one guest image (REQ-450's freshness, REQ-454's two concurrent capsules), the
# forward drop becoming ours instead of the host's — was waiting on the answer.
# `probe/netns.sh` established the namespace behaviour with veths and a
# simulated guest; this one boots the *real* capsule, because reading
# firecracker's source is not running it. Run 2026-08-11: 9 assertions, green
# (doctrine EVD-018). It is kept runnable because it is that evidence.
#
# So, unlike every other probe here, this one deliberately breaks the rule about
# not borrowing live addressing: it uses the real tap name, the real /30 and the
# real volume, because the thing under test is the real guest image, which has
# net.nix baked into it. That is why it refuses to start while the devshell tap
# exists or a VM is running — the two shapes must not be up at once.
#
#   root ns          nothing: no tap, no route to the guest, no way in but the
#                    unix socket below
#   cap-capsule ns   vm-capsule  10.99.0.1/30   <- created *inside* the ns
#                    firecracker, as you, with its tap resolved in here
#                    a socat relay on $SOCKDIR/ssh.sock -> 10.99.0.2:22
#   guest            10.99.0.2, bit-identical to what the tap shape boots
#
# What it does *not* test, on purpose: egress. There is no upstream in the
# namespace at all, so "the guest cannot reach the internet" would pass for the
# wrong reason — the trap probe/netns.sh already paid for twice. Egress under
# netns is stage 2 of that probe plus a proxy joined to the namespace, and it
# belongs with the host module that creates the namespace for real.
#
# The pair that does mean something is here instead: the guest is reachable
# *inside* the namespace and unreachable *outside* it, both asserted, plus the
# unix socket as the only way across.
#
# Boots the real capsule against its real volume, so it shuts the guest down
# over ssh before it kills anything (a killed VMM is a power cut; CLAUDE.md).
#
# Run: sudo probe-netns-boot     (from the repo, so $PWD/.vm is the VM's state)
#
# Takes a couple of minutes: a build, a boot, and a clean shutdown. It needs an
# ssh identity the guest authorises and finds your agent itself — see
# `human_ssh_identity` in the harness, which is there because `sudo` strips
# SSH_AUTH_SOCK and the first run of this probe failed three checks for exactly
# that reason.
#
# `probe/harness.sh` is concatenated ahead of this by flake.nix, along with the
# values it takes from net.nix and targets/ — TAP, HOST_ADDR, GUEST_ADDR,
# PREFIX, VM and GUEST_REPO are set there, not here. The boot sequence itself
# also lives in the harness now, because probe/freshness.sh measures the same
# shape and two copies of it would be two answers.

# Deliberately no errexit: several of these tests are supposed to fail.
