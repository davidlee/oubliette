# Probe: can two capsules run at once, are they actually independent, and what
# does the second one cost? (doctrine IMP-426 P1b, REQ-454.)
#
# REQ-454 wants a candidate verified in a *separate* fresh capsule from the one
# that produced it, which is why `red-team.md` RT-1 asks for it and why CPT-002
# ranks it highest in the round: a verifier sharing a capsule with the worker it
# checks is not a verifier. So the question is not "does a second VM boot" — it
# is whether two capsules are independent in the four ways that would let one
# stand in judgement on the other, and what the pair costs.
#
# The four, each asserted rather than argued:
#
#   1. **Addressing.** Both guests are the same image at the same address in
#      their own namespace. The test is a marker file: the address that would
#      name your sibling names *you*. Under identical addressing a capsule has
#      no way to spell its sibling, which is stronger than a dropped route.
#   2. **Storage.** Two volumes, and neither guest can see the other's marker.
#   3. **History.** The two are provisioned from *different* base commits from
#      one image — the transport inversion's whole premise (NOTES item 17: the
#      base commit had to leave the closure, or N capsules means N images).
#   4. **Lifecycle.** Halting one leaves the other answering. This is the
#      assertion that forced `probe/harness.sh` to stop identifying a VMM by
#      name: with two capsules on one image, `pkill -f microvm@capsule` is a
#      power cut for the sibling and reads as a clean teardown while doing it.
#   5. **Perimeter.** Two policies at the same moment — one host allowed for the
#      capsule whose policy permits it and refused for the capsule whose policy
#      does not, then swapped so neither capsule can be merely dead. This is the
#      one claim `probe/netns-egress.sh` deliberately does not make: run 3 there
#      put *one* guest through two policies in turn, and sequential selection is
#      not simultaneous selection (NOTES item 36).
#
# It also collects from both, because attribution is half of REQ-454: a verdict
# that cannot be tied to the capsule that produced it is not evidence. The two
# quarantines land under this probe's own state, not the operator's.
#
# Judgement calls, as in probe/freshness.sh:
#
#   1. **Real capsules, real size.** Two guests at the probe target's declared RAM.
#      A shrunken second capsule would measure a capsule nobody runs, and the
#      cost is the point of the exercise.
#   2. **Its own state, never `.vm/capsule`.** Two state directories under
#      `.vm/pair-*`, removed afterwards (CAPSULE_KEEP=1 to keep them).
#   3. **One runner, deliberately.** Both capsules boot the same store path,
#      because that is the shape being priced. It is also what makes the
#      identity problem real instead of hypothetical — and what this probe found:
#      the host programs were built per socket, so a second capsule had no way
#      in. One set of them now, `--capsule <name>` per call.
#
# Run: sudo probe-two-capsules [REF_A] [REF_B]
#
# The refs default to the target repo's HEAD and its parent — any two commit-ish
# will do, they only have to differ. Not the guest's branch: the target declares
# no branch any more, and `$WORK_BRANCH` is the other thing called one here.
#
# `probe/harness.sh` is concatenated ahead of this by flake.nix along with the
# values it takes from net.nix and targets/, and it carries the boot fixture
# these two capsules share.

# Deliberately no errexit: several of these tests are supposed to fail.
