# Probe: what does a *fresh* capsule cost, and which of REQ-450's five freshness
# axes does this mechanism actually satisfy? (doctrine IMP-426 P1a.)
#
# The bar for this round is a price, not a proof: every figure below is meant to
# answer "costs about this much, here's the shape, here's what it breaks". Hence
# `measure` alongside `check` — the numbers are the point, and they travel with
# the assertions that say what state produced them.
#
# Three judgement calls are baked in, and they decide what the numbers mean:
#
#   1. **"Usable" means provisioned.** A capsule that boots and answers ssh but
#      holds an empty repository is not one a worker can be given. So
#      time-to-usable is boot + provision, and the two are also reported apart,
#      because only the second scales with the target repo.
#
#   2. **It never touches the operator's volume.** Freshness means creating and
#      destroying volumes; a probe that did that to `.vm/$VM` would be a probe
#      you could run exactly once. This one boots the same guest image against
#      its own state directory and deletes it afterwards (CAPSULE_KEEP=1 to
#      keep it). That is also what makes the warm figure honest: the warm boot
#      is this probe's own cold volume, one halt later.
#
#   3. **The cold *build* is not measured, and cannot be here.** The namespace
#      has no upstream at all, so nothing in the guest can fetch a crate — the
#      first `cargo build` on a fresh volume is the largest cost freshness
#      actually imposes, and measuring it needs the proxy joined to the
#      namespace, i.e. the host module. Recorded as not-measured rather than
#      estimated. The discarded cache is asserted here; its price is not.
#
# Run: sudo probe-freshness [REF]     (REF defaults to the target repo's HEAD)
#
# Takes several minutes: two boots, a 32 MiB provision and two shutdowns. It
# needs an ssh identity the guest authorises, for the same reason and with the
# same escape hatches as probe-netns-boot.
#
# `probe/harness.sh` is concatenated ahead of this by flake.nix, along with the
# values it takes from net.nix and targets/. The boot sequence is the harness's
# too — this probe and probe/netns-boot.sh measure and assert the same shape.

# Deliberately no errexit: several of these tests are supposed to fail.
