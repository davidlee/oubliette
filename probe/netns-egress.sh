# Probe: does the *perimeter* survive the move into a namespace?
# (docs/plan-c-multi-capsule.md, "Netns per capsule"; docs/status.md, "Egress
# under netns is unproven")
#
# The last unverified claim in the netns shape, and the only one left that is
# security-shaped. `probe/netns.sh` proved the confinement with veths and a
# simulated guest, and `probe/netns-boot.sh` proved firecracker boots with its
# tap inside a namespace — but neither has ever had a proxy in it. Both
# deliberately refuse to say anything about egress: netns-boot's namespace has
# no upstream at all, so a denial there would pass for the wrong reason, and
# netns.sh's stage 2 reached the internet with a bare `curl` rather than through
# tinyproxy and an allowlist.
#
# So this one boots the real capsule, joins the real `capsule-proxy` to its
# namespace, and asks the guest to get out — once to a host the allowlist
# permits and once to a host it does not. Everything downstream of it (the
# per-instance proxy units, `host/perimeter-check.nix` rewritten around the
# namespace's own ip_forward) is written against a live host and a fail-closed
# guard, where each iteration costs a rebuild; this costs a run.
#
# Like `probe/netns-boot.sh` and for the same reason, it breaks the rule about
# borrowing live addressing in exactly one place: the thing under test is the
# real guest image, which has net.nix baked into it. Everything the probe *adds*
# is the harness's fabric, on names and addressing `flake.nix`'s `probeFabric`
# refuses at eval to share with `capsules.nix` — which this file is the reason
# for. It said this same sentence while adding `eg-rt` at 10.101.0.1 with a route
# for 10.100.0.0/16, all three of them the live aggregator's, because the module
# copied its map from here after the shape was verified (NOTES item 38).
#
#   root ns            pr-rt      10.111.0.1/30   forwards + masquerades
#                      routes 10.110.0.0/16 and the guest via 10.111.0.2
#   probe-egress ns    pr-up      10.111.0.2/30   the aggregator: every
#                      pr-wan0    10.110.0.1/30   capsule's proxy gets out
#                      pr-wan1    10.110.1.1/30   through here, and this is
#                                                 where the drops live
#   cap-capsule ns     vm-capsule 10.99.0.1/30    <- the real tap, real /30
#                      pr-out0    10.110.0.2/30   <- the proxy's way out
#                      capsule-proxy, bound to the tap address
#                      firecracker, as you, with the real volume
#   guest              10.99.0.2, no default route, no resolver
#   probe-peer ns      pr-out1    10.110.1.2/30   a second capsule, VM-less:
#                                                 it exists to be unreachable
#
# Three claims, each with the control that makes it evidence rather than luck:
#
#   1. the guest gets out through the proxy, and only to the allowlist;
#   2. the guest cannot get out any other way — and the control proves it is the
#      namespace's ip_forward doing that, by turning it on and watching the wall
#      fall over;
#   3. a capsule cannot use the aggregator to reach its sibling or the host's own
#      networks, with the same flush-and-retry control.
#
# The upstream is given a route back to the guest and the host masquerades the
# guest's address too, both on purpose: that is the most permissive upstream
# there could be, so a "blocked" result can only mean the capsule namespace
# blocked it. Without a return path every negative passes for the wrong reason —
# the trap probe/netns.sh paid for twice.
#
# No figures: this round's bar is a proof, not a price. What would be worth
# measuring — throughput through the proxy with a forwarding hop and NAT under
# it — is a figure of the internet rather than of the shape.
#
# DNS is the one thing here that needs a host-side edit and cannot be faked. The
# host's resolver stub is on the *root* namespace's loopback, and loopback is
# per-namespace, so a capsule namespace inherits an /etc/resolv.conf naming
# 127.0.0.53 with nothing behind it. The designed fix is `DNSStubListenerExtra=`
# on the capsule-facing address plus /etc/netns/<ns>/resolv.conf; the probe
# writes the second half itself, detects whether the first half is in place, and
# falls back to a public resolver with a NOTE if it is not — a fallback that
# silently loses the host's DoT hop, which is exactly why it is recorded rather
# than defaulted to.
#
# Run: sudo probe-netns-egress    (from the repo, so $PWD/.vm is the VM's state)
#
# Takes a couple of minutes: a build, a boot, and a clean shutdown. Needs an ssh
# identity the guest authorises — `sudo` strips SSH_AUTH_SOCK, so the harness
# finds the agent itself and refuses before booting anything if there is none.
#
# `probe/harness.sh` is concatenated ahead of this by flake.nix, along with the
# values it takes from net.nix and targets/: TAP, HOST_ADDR, GUEST_ADDR,
# PREFIX, VM, PROXY_PORT, PROXY, ALLOWLIST and SEALED_ALLOWLIST are set there,
# not here.

# Deliberately no errexit: several of these tests are supposed to fail.
