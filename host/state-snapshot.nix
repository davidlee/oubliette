# The guest half of a collect's *sideband*: the state that is not a commit.
#
# A capsule's result has two halves with different lifecycles. The code half is
# `refs/heads/*` and `capsule-collect` has always fetched it. The other half —
# the target's gitignored runtime state, plus whatever the agent has not
# committed — exists only in the guest's worktree, and a collect that takes the
# first and drops the second reports a nine-phase run as one sha (NOTES item 32).
#
# So this builds a commit whose tree is *only* that state, under a ref namespace
# no branch ever occupies, and `capsule-collect` fetches it with a second
# refspec. Git's object model does the transport, the hashing and the
# deduplication; the commit message pins which code the state was the state of.
#
# **Pushed at each call, never baked into the guest's closure**, exactly as
# `host/observe.nix` is and for its two reasons — host-side policy about what
# leaves a capsule, and a copy on a volume from an older build is drift nothing
# reports — plus one this file learned the hard way: a capsule with a real
# workload in it cannot be rebuilt without a restart, and the first capsule that
# needed this was thirteen hours into a nine-phase slice.
#
# **No login shell**, like `observe`: nothing here reads the guest's
# `environment.variables`, so item 24's trap cannot arise.
#
# **One line, tab-separated, fixed order, defined here and nowhere else:**
# `<commit-or-dash>\t<bytes>\t<files>`. Diagnostics go to stderr, and a state
# half that cannot be taken is a `-` rather than a failure — the code refs are
# still worth collecting.
#
# **One text and no instantiations at all** (NOTES item 51). Every value this
# script is *about* — the checkout, the ceiling, the declared templates — arrives
# on its command line beside the stage and the unit, so the same store path runs
# in a capsule, at a human's checkout and in a build sandbox. It used to be a
# function of the checkout, then a function of the checkout at three call sites,
# which is the shape a socket path baked into a store path had before item 20:
# one program per instance of the thing the program is about.
#
# The three callers, and what each is:
#
#   - `capsule-collect` pushes it into a guest — the capsule's own checkout, and
#     the `all` sweep, because untracked-but-not-ignored there is *the agent's
#     uncommitted work* and one agent works on one thing.
#   - `capsule-brief --from-host` runs it here, at `target.path` (NOTES item 42),
#     with the `declared` sweep, because in a human's checkout that same class is
#     whatever is lying around. The scope is an argument for exactly this reason
#     and has no default: the value a missing one would fall back to is the
#     failure (item 28).
#   - `snapshotCases` runs it against a checkout the sandbox builds, because the
#     branch that decides what an exhibit *contains* is one a live host reaches
#     only by driving a real unit of work in a real capsule.
#
# **Usage, and the order is the interface:**
#
#     <stage> <unit> <scope> <work> <max> <template>...
#
# The templates are variadic, so they are last. Nothing here has a default except
# the stage, and nothing infers a value it was not given.
#
# **And every one of them now comes off a document** (NOTES item 51 step 4).
# **Including the last one** (step 6): `needsUnit` was an eval-time predicate
# over `target.nix`'s `statePaths`, exported from here for `capsule-collect` to
# ask before it opens a door — so this file took the target's list for that one
# thing while the script it builds took the same list on argv. It takes **no
# target value at all** now. The host asks a loaded document
# (`profileNeedsUnit`, host/profile.nix) and the script below asks the arguments
# it was handed; two ends of one fact, and neither is a property of the build.
