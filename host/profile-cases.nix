# What a profile document is, and what a bad one gets — NOTES item 51 step 3.
#
# The third kind of check (CLAUDE.md) over a *library* rather than a program:
# `host/profile.nix` ships a shell fragment for `host/record.nix`'s reason, so
# what a suite can run is that fragment spliced into something with a `main`. The
# fragment is handed here from the same construction `flake.nix` gives every
# caller, so there is one text and this suite is not a second render of it.
#
# **Two subjects, and both are the shipped ones.** The fragment, and the
# directory this host actually rendered — the first case loads `<target>.json`
# with no environment at all, which is also the only thing that makes the
# document a build input of anything
# ([item 37](../docs/ledger/037-a-teardown-that-only-unnames.md): a document
# nothing builds is a document nothing checks).
#
# What a live host reaches only expensively or not at all is everything after
# that: a second target on this host, a document truncated mid-write, one from a
# newer schema, one whose ceiling is missing. Each of those is a rebuild, a
# migration, or a fault on a host holding live work.
#
# Two rules for a case here, as everywhere: assert the **reason** and not only
# the status, since a refusal for the wrong reason is a different program
# passing; and every one of these was watched going red against a mutated copy of
# the fragment.
