# The assignment record — what a slot is currently *supposed* to be.
# [docs/contract-assignment.md](../docs/contract-assignment.md) owns the field
# list and the authority split; this file is only the mechanism, and it is
# deliberately a shell fragment rather than a program.
#
# **Why a fragment.** Two things write a record and one reads it, and they are
# already separate store paths for reasons that have nothing to do with records:
# `capsule` carries no transport (host/cli.nix) and `capsule-provision` carries
# one and exists in two copies (host/programs.nix). A record *library* injected
# into each is one definition of the path, the locking and the generation; a
# record *program* would be a fifth thing to install and would still need the
# same fragment to call it. Same seam as `transport` and `statePaths`, same
# reason.
#
# **Desired state only.** Nothing observed goes in here — no head sha, no
# baseline verdict, no disk. Those are measured per call (host/observe.nix), and
# keeping the two apart is most of the value of writing the contract down: a
# record that mixes them cannot answer *is this slot doing what it was told*.
{pkgs}: {
  # Callers add these to their own `runtimeInputs`, so the dependency is visible
  # at each call site rather than assumed.
  inputs = [pkgs.jq pkgs.util-linux pkgs.coreutils];

  # Expects `$recordRoot` in scope — the state root the record lives under.
  # Deliberately **not** `$state`, the name `statePaths` uses: `quarantineOf` in
  # host/cli.nix already has a `local state` as a loop variable, and one of the two
  # callers there would have silently shadowed the other. A fragment injected into
  # somebody else's scope should not take a name that scope already uses.
  fragment = ''
    # `<root>/slot/<name>/`, not `<root>/<name>/` as the contract's prose has it.
    # The state root already holds `collect/`, and `capsules.nix` would accept a
    # slot called `collect` — an 11-character limit is the only name rule there
    # is. One namespacing directory is a structural fix; a list of reserved words
    # that grows every time this repo adds a state directory is not.
    slotDir() { printf '%s/slot/%s' "$recordRoot" "$1"; }
    recordOf() { printf '%s/assignment.json' "$(slotDir "$1")"; }

    # A slot nothing has assigned reads as `{}` rather than as an error: never
    # having been assigned is a state, and the field accessor below turns it into
    # `-` per field. `unassigned` in the contract's state model is exactly this.
    recordRead() { cat "$(recordOf "$1")" 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'; }

    # One field, `-` when absent or null, for a status column. `--arg` rather
    # than string interpolation because a field name reaching jq as code is the
    # same class of mistake as a path reaching a shell as code.
    recordField() {
      recordRead "$1" | jq -r --arg f "$2" '(.[$f] // "-") | if type == "array" then (if length == 0 then "-" else join(",") end) else tostring end'
    }

    # Mutate under `flock`, read-modify-write, and the generation bumped by the
    # write itself rather than by the caller — a caller that computes the next
    # generation is a caller that can compute it wrong, and every mutation bumps
    # it (docs/contract-assignment.md).
    #
    # The lock makes read-modify-write atomic, which is the whole of the
    # concurrency discipline this size of problem warrants. What it does *not* do
    # is the other half of what `generation` is for: **a command that acts on a
    # slot should state the generation it is acting for and be refused if that is
    # not current.** That matters once anything detached exists (Plan D D6) and
    # there is nothing to refuse today, so the field is written and the check is
    # not built — which is the right order, because retrofitting the field would
    # mean rewriting every record and retrofitting the check means adding an
    # argument.
    #
    # Written aside and moved, the same discipline `capsule-inject` uses on a
    # credential: a dropped write must not leave half a document that still
    # parses.
    # The locked section is a subshell with the lock on its own fd rather than
    # `exec 9>` in the function, so the descriptor and the variables both go away
    # when it does — a lock held for the rest of the program's life is a lock
    # nobody remembers taking.
    # `recordWrite <slot> <filter> [jq args…]` — anything after the filter is
    # passed to jq, which is how a value reaches it. **Never interpolate a value
    # into the filter**: free text like `purpose` would then be jq code, the same
    # class of mistake as a path reaching a shell as code, and `purpose` is
    # explicitly whatever a client puts in it.
    # `recordAlso` — a hook a caller may define, run inside the slot's lock and
    # *before* the document is written. It exists for one thing: `capsule <slot>
    # policy` re-points that slot's allowlist symlink in the same breath as the
    # record, because a record and a perimeter that disagree is a perimeter
    # nobody can read (NOTES item 36). A hook rather than an argument because
    # `recordWrite`'s trailing arguments are jq's, and every other caller leaves
    # it undefined.
    #
    # Before, not after, and the ordering is the whole of what it buys. Neither
    # order is safe for both a tightening and a widening, so the one taken is the
    # one with a clean failure: a hook that fails leaves the record untouched and
    # nothing has changed at all. The other order's failure leaves a record
    # claiming a perimeter that was never applied.
    #
    # It fails the write by exiting the locked subshell, so `recordWrite` returns
    # non-zero and prints no generation — a caller with a hook must check.

        # Three things are appended *after* the caller's filter: the absent-field
        # skeleton, then `generation` and `schema` — so no caller can spell either
        # of the last two and have it survive, and none of them can be forgotten
        # by a caller who only meant to set one field.
        #
        # The absent ones are written as absent rather than omitted, so a record
        # says for itself which half of the contract is built. Each waits on a
        # different mechanism: `policy` on a declared set to select from, and
        # `extras` and `image` on a fragment vocabulary and a composition to
        # resolve (docs/contract-flavour.md).
        #
        # `profile_snapshot` is **filled** since [NOTES item 52](../docs/ledger/052-the-document-leaves-the-store.md)
        # step 3 — a provision copies the document it was taken under into the
        # slot's own directory and records the digest of that copy
        # (host/cli.nix's `pinProfile`). It stays in this skeleton because a
        # record written by any other verb has no provision behind it and must
        # not claim a pin. Absent here means the slot reads whatever this host
        # declares now, which is what every record said before that step.
        #
        # Each step that can fail exits the subshell itself, and is not left to
        # errexit: a caller that checks `recordWrite … || …` switches errexit
        # off in here, and then a failed jq left an empty file for `mv` to put
        # over the record, and the `printf` after it reported success
        # (SL-001's RV-008 F-6).
