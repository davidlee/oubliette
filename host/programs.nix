# Everything the human runs *at* a capsule, built once for both paths — plus the
# one script a capsule runs *about itself*, which is here for the same reason:
# built once, so neither path can be built without it.
#
# There are **three** call sites and there must not be three implementations: the
# devshell builds these to reach the guest straight over the tap,
# `host/services.nix` builds the same set to reach it through the capsule's relay
# socket because under netns the guest is not routable from the root namespace at
# all, and `probe-freshness` builds its own to exercise the real programs on the
# real seam. The only difference between them is `access`, which is why that is
# the argument — and it is *one* argument holding two fields rather than two
# arguments, because a second argument is a second thing three call sites can
# each forget, and one of them did (NOTES item 34).
#
# `access.transport` is a shell fragment (`host/guest-ssh.nix`), not a value, and one
# store path serves every capsule because of it: spliced at the top of each
# program, it resolves which capsule this invocation means, strips that argument
# out of `"$@"`, and sets `ssh_cmd` to the argv that reaches it. Baking a
# transport instead — which is what an argv-valued `sshArgs` did — gives one
# program per capsule, since the only thing that differs between two capsules is
# a socket path.
#
# Everything else here is derivation, not decision: who the host talks to
# (`agent@`, the unprivileged guest user), where the checkout is, and which
# payloads leave this host. All of it comes from `net.nix`, `target.nix` and
# `setup.nix` — nothing target-shaped is spelled here.
