# What the module path's wrapper hands a program — `ISS-004`.
#
# **A fourth kind of check, and the reason it had to exist.** The three in
# `CLAUDE.md` cannot see this one between them: `hostModuleUnits` *evaluates* the
# module, so it proves the wrapper builds and says nothing about what it does;
# the `*Cases` suites run a program's *own text* against stubs, so they never see
# a wrapper at all. A wrapper defeating the program it wraps falls between them,
# which is why `ISS-004` shipped with item 52 naming the gap in the abstract
# ("nothing pins that the module's `wrap` exports the directory the module also
# creates") and reading it as a test that had not been written rather than as a
# defect. The subject here is neither a program nor a fragment but the
# **composition** — a wrapper around an inner program — and the question is
# whether a value the caller set survives the last line before that program runs.
#
# The subject is the shipped builder (`host/wrap.nix`), **handed a fixture** like
# the guard's stubbed kernel and the front end's pool that is nobody's: the paths
# below are not this host's, because what is pinned is the *rule* — supply a
# default, impose nothing — and a suite spelling `/var/lib/capsule` would go green
# on a host that had moved it. Each variable's *value* is read from the same
# `defaults` the wrapper builds from, so no case can agree with itself about one;
# the *set* of them is spelled out below instead, and the comment there is why.
#
# **One case is over a real program, and it takes two things from this host.**
# Whether the wrapper leaves `CAPSULE_REPO` alone is only visible as what the
# program does without it, so that case wraps the shipped `capsule-provision`.
# Its slot is one this host declares, because the program has the declared list
# baked in and refuses any other `--capsule` before it reads a checkout — which
# is the program, not a borrowed fixture, exactly as in `gitChannelCases`. Its
# paths are still nobody's.
#
# Both rules for writing a case apply. Each override case asserts *which* value
# arrived and not merely that the program ran, since a wrapper that dropped the
# variable entirely and one that honoured it are the same exit status; and the
# whole suite was watched going red against `wrap` as it shipped before this —
# the five `export V=<default>` lines — where every override case failed with the
# fixture's own path as the value it got.
#
# Then mutated, one break at a time, to see *which* rounds go red, which is how
# two of these got their present shape. Four rounds and what each one taught:
#
#   - the five bare `export V=<default>` lines, i.e. `wrap` as it shipped —
#     the five override cases, and nothing else. The red this suite was for.
#   - `"$@"` unquoted — **the build**, on `SC2068`, so no case ran at all and it
#     reads exactly like nothing going red (CLAUDE.md). `"$*"` is the honest
#     mutation that gets past shellcheck, and it lands on `argc` as 1 rather
#     than 4. A stub printing `"$*"` would have re-joined the split arguments
#     into the string the case wanted, which is why it prints each one bracketed.
#   - escaping *twice* — the space case, whose default arrives carrying its own
#     quote characters. This is the count-of-one rule and the live risk here.
#   - `escapeShellArg` removed — **nothing**, and that is a fact about the
#     construction rather than a hole: `lib.escapeShellArg` is a no-op on a path
#     of ordinary characters, and the right-hand side of an assignment is not
#     word-split, so even the spaced fixture arrives whole without it. A fixture
#     hostile enough to discriminate is not available — `writeShellApplication`
#     shellchecks the *built wrapper*, so a `$` in a declared path is `SC2016`
#     escaped or not, and a bare `'` is a parse error. That class is caught one
#     layer before this suite runs, and by shellcheck rather than by a case.
