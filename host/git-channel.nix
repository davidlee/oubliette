# The git channel, host-initiated in both directions.
#
# The host used to serve a mirror and wait for the guest to push to it. It now
# does the initiating: `capsule-provision` pushes history in, `capsule-collect`
# fetches work out. Neither is a service, nothing listens, and the guest cannot
# start either one. NOTES item 18 is why, with the measurement.
#
# Two properties this shape has and the served mirror could not:
#
#   - The host's git only ever runs in a repository the host authored — the
#     target repo it pushes from, and the quarantine repo it fetches into. The
#     guest's repo is only ever the guest's. No repository is written by two
#     uids, so there is nothing to share, no setgid, no `sharedRepository`, and
#     nothing a compromised guest can leave in a repo the human's git will read.
#   - The base commit is an argument, not a value baked into the guest's
#     closure. That was one of the two things NOTES item 17 needed out of the
#     closure for a single guest image; the other is the address, which netns
#     handles.
#
# Jail-agnostic in the same sense as perimeter/: it knows a git URL, an ssh
# destination and a shell fragment that reaches either. No tap, no namespace, no
# hypervisor. Under netns the URL is unchanged and the fragment grows a
# `ProxyCommand` against the capsule's unix socket (NOTES item 17) — that is the
# whole difference, and it is at the call site.
{
  pkgs,
  lib,
  # Which target this invocation is about, as a fragment that resolves
  # `--profile` and loads the document (host/profile.nix, NOTES item 51 step 4).
  # `path` — what `capsule-provision` pushes from — was the whole of what this
  # file wanted from a target, and it is `$profile_path` now, so neither program
  # here is a function of which project the host confines. What a fetch may write
  # is not the project's to say either way (NOTES item 36) — see `policies`.
  profileSelect,
  # The host's policy vocabulary (policies.nix): each entry's `collectMaxPackBytes`
  # and `mayCollect` are the two ingestion limbs, and a collect selects one by
  # name at run time. Baked as a case rather than taken as a byte count, for the
  # reason the whole item exists: a caller selects from a declared set and does
  # not author a bound, so `--policy sealed` is a choice and `--max-bytes 10G`
  # would be an authority. `capsule-host` resolves its allowlist the same way
  # (flake.nix).
  policies,
  # Where to ssh, e.g. `agent@10.99.0.2` — for the *state* half of a collect
  # only, which is a script pushed at the guest rather than a question git can
  # answer (`snapshot` below). The code half still knows only a URL.
  guestHost,
  # The guest-side snapshot as `{script, argsFragment}` (host/state-snapshot.nix,
  # NOTES item 32): a store path pushed on stdin at each collect and never baked
  # into the guest, plus the command line that points it at a checkout. Neither
  # this nor `refresh` below is nullable any more (NOTES item 51 step 6): the
  # code-only collect and the two-step provision are still here and are branches
  # this program takes on the **document it loaded**, so that a host confining
  # two projects gets each one's answer rather than the build's.
  snapshot,
  # The third step of a provision, as a fragment defining `refreshInvoke`
  # (host/refresh.nix): regenerate the derived state the push cannot carry, in
  # the checkout the push just made.
  refresh,
  # The branch a capsule's work lives on inside the guest — a constant, and not
  # the target's to name (docs/contract-target.md). The guest's seed sets the
  # same one; they must agree or a provision moves a ref and checks nothing out,
  # which is why it is threaded from one place rather than spelled here.
  workBranch,
  # The guest's checkout as a git URL: a **fragment** defining `guestRepoUrl`,
  # since step 4 — the host half is `net.nix`'s and the path half is the
  # profile's, so it is built at run time (host/programs.nix). Jail-shaped, so
  # injected.
  guestRepo,
  # Which capsule, how to reach it, and git's own view of that: a shell fragment
  # that sets `$capsule` and `ssh_cmd`, consumes `--capsule` out of `"$@"`
  # (host/guest-ssh.nix) and exports `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`. Jail-shaped, so injected
  # — and required, because without it neither program knows which capsule it is
  # for. Built in `host/programs.nix` because `capsule-brief` pushes over the
  # same door and a second spelling of one conversion is a second thing to keep
  # right.
  gitSsh,
  # Where the quarantine is and what its refs are called (host/quarantine.nix).
  # Its own file since `capsule-adopt` reads what this writes: a convention with
  # two programs over it is a construction, not a note saying don't spell it
  # twice.
  quarantine,
  # The *inbound* state half, as `{fragment, …}` (host/brief.nix, NOTES item 35):
  # one capsule's collected state pushed into another's checkout, which is step
  # (2) of a provision and the reason an audit capsule can read what an
  # implementation capsule was working on.
