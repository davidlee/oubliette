# `capsule-collect`'s guest half, run against a checkout the sandbox builds,
# plus the token bound that stands between an assignment and a path.
#
# The third kind of check (CLAUDE.md), a third instance of it, and the branch
# it exists for is item 32's scope invariant: *a collect brings back the
# out-of-band state of the work the capsule was assigned, and none that is
# not*. Reaching that on a live host means a capsule that has driven a real
# unit of work in a checkout holding several — which is a thirteen-hour slice
# and one host, so it is asserted here on a checkout that holds two units and
# costs a second. The seam is `host/state-snapshot.nix`'s script, which takes
# the checkout it runs in on its command line, exactly as `brief.nix`'s runner
# does.
#
# The token cases are here rather than in a suite of their own because they
# are the *other half of the same control*: the bound is what makes a unit
# token safe to substitute into the middle of a path, and a suite that pinned
# the scoping without pinning the bound would pin the half that is easy.
#
# Only built for a target that declares `statePaths`: with no snapshot there is
# nothing to assert about one, which is the call site's condition and not this
# file's.
