# `capsule`'s two *filled-in* flags, run against a declaration that is not this
# host's: the policy a slot resolves to, and — since item 51 step 4 — the profile
# it does. Both are the same shape, which is why they are one suite: a program
# refuses without the flag, this front end reads host state and fills it, and an
# explicit one wins.
#
# The third kind of check (CLAUDE.md), and its fourth instance. The branches
# worth pinning are refusals a live host reaches expensively or destructively
# — a slot declaring an empty set, an assigner naming a policy outside its
# slot's set, and a re-point that cannot be written — and the one success that
# matters is that the record and the allowlist link move *together*. Reaching
# any of them here would mean editing `capsules.nix`, rebuilding the host, and
# writing the live record of a slot that is actually assigned.
#
# Two seams, both already the ones the rule asks for: `capsules` is substituted
# the way `guard-cases.nix` substitutes it, and `moduleState` — the one thing
# tying this program to this host — is `host/cli.nix`'s argument, so the record
# lands in the sandbox. Every real call site takes its default, so the two
# shipped copies are still one store path.
#
# The one suite that re-renders what it pins, and deliberately: a fixture is the
# subject. The four values below are the shipped ones, threaded from the call
# site so this render differs from the shipped front end in nothing else.

    # met again by hand since). So one refspec is refused and the other is taken,
    # and the repository ends holding one assignment's code beside another's
    # state under two names that say they belong together.
    #
    # Reaching that on a host costs two assignments to one slot and a capsule to
    # fill them, which is what makes it this suite's: the fetch is git's, the
    # *reporting* is the front end's, and only the second is what this pins.
