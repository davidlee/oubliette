# Where a capsule's collected exhibit lives, host-side — one definition.
#
# `capsule-collect` writes it and `capsule-adopt` reads it, and until the second
# of those existed the convention was a `let` binding inside the git channel with
# a note saying not to spell it twice. Two programs is where a note stops being
# enough: **anything built at two call sites needs one construction, not two
# careful ones** (CLAUDE.md), and a path convention is built at a call site the
# same way a program is.
#
# `perimeter/default.nix` defines the same two variables and deliberately still
# does, because it may not import anything host-shaped — that is what keeps a
# seatbelt or VM shape able to reuse it (docs/plan-b-other-jails.md). So this
# collapses two of the three copies and leaves the one that has a reason. Change
# this, change that.
#
# Shell fragments rather than values, because none of it is known at eval:
# `$capsule` is a run-time argument (NOTES item 20) and `CAPSULE_STATE` belongs
# to the process — the module path wraps its copies with the host's own state
# directory (host/services.nix), the devshell path falls through to the
# checkout's `.vm/host`, and neither is a nix value. Every consumer here has
# `$capsule` in scope before it uses any of this, because the transport fragment
# is the first thing in all of them.
rec {
  # Sets `root` and `state`. `CAPSULE_ROOT` is the checkout, `CAPSULE_STATE` the
  # directory this host keeps per-capsule state in — a wrapped program on `$PATH`
  # has the second and must not derive it from `$PWD`, which is the trap the
  # module's `wrap` exists for.

  # The bare repository a capsule's collect fetches into, as a shell expression.

  # identity to pass around and nothing to keep in step.
  #
  # `…Of` takes the shell expression holding a name, because **one program reads
  # two capsules' quarantines**: `capsule-brief` puts capsule `a`'s collected
  # state into capsule `b` (NOTES item 35), so the source is an argument and the
  # destination is `$capsule`. The bare forms are that function at `$capsule`,
  # which is what every other consumer means — one definition, not a second

  # `heads/` and `state/` are siblings rather than the second nested under the

  # directory/file ref-lock collision, loud but timed by the guest (NOTES item
  # 32).

  # An opaque identifier an operator typed, on its way to the end of a ref or of
  # a path — or, since item 32's unit token, into the *middle* of one. Bounded to
  # `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` minus the two names that are not identifiers, for one
  # reason: such a name may identify an instance and may never widen a
  # perimeter. `git update-ref` would refuse a malformed ref anyway, and nothing
  # would refuse a malformed directory; both are caught here, at the end that has
  # the argument in argv and before a round trip rather than after one.
  #
  # **`.` and `..` are named separately, because the character class admits
  # them.** That was harmless while every token landed at the *end* of a name —
  # `refs/capsule/state/..` is a ref `update-ref` refuses, and a capsule's name
  # is checked against the declared list before it is a directory — so the
  # comment claiming "no '..'" was aspirational rather than wrong in effect. A
  # token substituted into the middle of a path is where it stops being
  # harmless: `.doctrine/state/slice/..` is `.doctrine/state`, which is the token
  # widening the perimeter it exists not to widen. Refused here rather than at
  # the new call site, because a bound with an exception is two bounds.
  #
  # `value` is the shell expression holding it and `shown` is what the operator
  # actually typed, because the two differ once one flag carries two tokens
  # (`--state a:implementation`) and a refusal that quotes the wrong one sends
  # the reader looking in the wrong place.
  #
  # The message says what the bound *is* and lets `shown` say which argument
  # broke it, rather than describing where any one of them lands. It used to say
  # "one link of a capsule's chain … on the end of a ref", which was true of the
  # two call sites that existed and became false for the third: a unit token is
  # not a chain link and goes into the *middle* of a path. A refusal naming the
  # wrong reason is a different program passing.
