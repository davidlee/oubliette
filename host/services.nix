# The host half of the perimeter, under its own uid and its own resource
# ceilings, with every capsule in its own network namespace. NixOS-only by
# nature, hence here and not in `perimeter/` — it takes the proxy `capsule-host`
# composes and gives it a unit, plus the guard that is this path's version of
# `preflight` and `watch`.
#
# It used to run two services. The other was a git daemon serving a mirror the
# guest pushed to, and it needed a system uid, a shared group, a setgid state
# directory and a `safe.directory` exception to work at all — all of which
# existed to confine a `receive-pack` the host had to run. The host now
# initiates git in both directions instead (`host/git-channel.nix`), so the
# service, the uid, the group, the mirror and the exception are gone rather than
# hardened. NOTES item 18.
#
# What this buys over `capsule-host` (which is kept: it needs no root, no
# rebuild, and is the portable path):
#
#   - tinyproxy is C parsing guest-authored HTTP; as `capsule-host` it runs as
#     you, with ambient access to ~/.ssh, ~/.claude and every repo. Here it gets
#     a system uid holding nothing, plus ProtectHome and a namespace.
#   - it loses the LAN and loopback, keeping only the guest and the resolver.
#   - cgroup ceilings, which nothing had before (NOTES open item 12).
#   - **a namespace per capsule** (`host/netns.nix`), which is what makes more
#     than one of them possible: identical addressing, one guest image, and a
#     forwarding switch that is ours rather than the host's.
#
# Not here: the nftables drop on the devshell path's tap, the interface-scoped
# port, and the sudoers rule that makes the drop readable. Those are the host's
# own config (README "Host requirements") and belong to the *tap* shape, which
# this path no longer uses.

        Holds one rendered profile document per target, `<name>.json`, read at
        run time by every host-side program through `profileLoad`
        (host/profile.nix). Outside the store on purpose (NOTES item 52): while
        the documents were a store path, adding a target was a rebuild and a
        switch, and no producer but nix could write one — which is the whole of
        what making a target run-time state was for (Plan D §6.1's controller
        that never runs `nixos-rebuild`).

        **This module owns the names it renders and nothing else here.** The
        activation script installs one document per target `target.nix` declares
        and overwrites it every time, because copy-if-absent would make an edit
        to `target.nix` invisible forever after the first boot — item 22's
        write-if-absent payload rule applied to a *derived* payload, which Plan D
        §6.3 already names as the thing to get right. A document under any other
        name is its writer's and nothing here touches it. So a document edited in
        place under this host's own target name is reverted at the next
        activation: `target.nix` is the source and the file is a render.

        traverse to, however carefully the bind names it, and opening `stateDir`
