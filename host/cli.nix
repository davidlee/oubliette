# `capsule` — the human's front end, and nothing else.
#
# NOTES item 20 decided the naming ahead of this: which capsule a program means
# is `--capsule <name>`, else `CAPSULE_NAME`, and the transport is derived from
# the name rather than baked into a store path. That left a front end with
# exactly three jobs: resolve a name, pick the copy of a program that can reach
# it, and exec. It owns no transport, no socket path of its own and no second
# implementation of anything below it.
#
# Resolving is now slightly more than reading a value, and deliberately so: the
# declared default went with slots being abstract, so an unnamed verb here means
# *the capsule that is up*, refusing when none or several are. That is a
# host-state answer, which the four programs must not have — see below.
#
# Why a program rather than more `just` recipes: the recipes need this checkout
# and a devshell, and on the module path a capsule outlives both — the units are
# on the host and a human logged into it has no repo. So the run-time verbs live
# here and `just` delegates to them (`just up` keeps only what genuinely needs
# the flake: `microvm -c`, which resolves the instance name as a flake attribute,
# NOTES item 21). One implementation, two ways to say it.
#
# **Picking a copy is a front end's latitude, not a program's.** Two copies of
# each of the four programs exist by design and carry different transports, and
# inside the repo the devshell's shadow the module's on PATH (CLAUDE.md). They
# refuse rather than guess, which is item 20's decision and stands; choosing
# between them is what a human's front end is for, and `just _capsule` was
# already doing it. This inherits that, so it exists in one place instead of
# beside every recipe. Note what it is *not*: this picks between two copies of
# another program, it does not carry two transports of its own.

  # may not do: validate a selection against the set the *slot* declares, and

  policies,
  # The host->guest ssh relaxation, for the *reachability probe* only
  # (host/guest-ssh.nix). The human's own door keeps the strict default, because a

  # would otherwise report a rotated host key as an unreachable guest.
  guestSsh,
  # Which `capsule-<verb>` programs this host actually has. `baseline` is absent
  # when the target declares none (host/programs.nix), and an unknown verb should
  # say so rather than exec a command that is not there.
  programVerbs,
  # Whether this target's state paths are scoped to a unit of work (NOTES item
  # 32). It decides two things here and nothing anywhere else: whether `unit` is
  # a verb at all, and whether a collect is handed the one the record holds. A
  # target with no hole in its policy gets neither, because a field nothing reads
  # is a field that will one day be believed.
  # The guest-side half of a status, as a store path pushed over the door
  # (host/observe.nix). A path and not a set of guest paths, deliberately: this
  # file asks a capsule what is true and does not know what `/work` is.
  observe,
  # What builds that program's command line, as **one opaque splice** for the
  # same reason (NOTES item 51 step 4): the profile reader, the record
  # convention and the argument order, composed in `host/programs.nix` beside the
  # paths they are about. The paths moved out of `observe`'s text and then off
  # `target.nix` entirely; they did not move into this file's vocabulary, and the
  # only thing this file spells about a target is a *name*.
  observeFragment,
  # Which verbs' programs read a profile, so this front end knows which ones to
  # fill a `--profile` in for (host/programs.nix). `inject` and `adopt` are not
  # among them, because neither is about a value the target supplies.
  profileVerbs,
  # Where the module keeps its state: quarantines and the assignment records. The
  # allowlist links are *not* in here — they are the one thing a proxy must read,
  # and this directory is the one place it may not (NOTES item 39,
  # host/services.nix's `allowlistDir`). On the module path this is not a guess at all —
  # that copy is wrapped with `CAPSULE_STATE` and three directories from the
  # host's own options (host/services.nix, host/wrap.nix), and `CAPSULE_STATE` is the first thing
  # `quarantineOf` tries. The literal is the *devshell* copy's guess at where the
  # module put things, and the record's root on both.
  #
  # **An argument with a default, and every real call site takes the default** —
  # so both copies are still one store path, and no run-time value can move a
  # record (CLAUDE.md: `CAPSULE_STATE` moves the quarantine and not the record,
  # deliberately, since a record for a devshell capsule would describe a slot that
  # does not exist). It is an argument for the reason `host/guard.nix`'s `tools`
  # is: the one thing tying this program to this host is what a case suite has to
  # substitute, and `policyCases` in flake.nix is what does.

  # (CLAUDE.md), and its `tap-up` is what both `microvm@<name>` and the tap unit
  # are conditioned on — so its absence is what "never created here" looks like,
  # and without asking, a start fails as a dependency error naming neither unit.
  # The justfile used to spell this; it asks `capsule <name> created` now.
  #

  # in `runtimeInputs`, so a sandbox can reach neither — and the query is here
  # rather than only the root step because every refusal before that step turns
  # on it. Which states count as stopped is the branch's text, not this one's.
  #
  # **`-k` is load-bearing** (design sec-3, `DEC-010`): it ignores a cached
