# What the module path hands a host-side program before it starts, and the one
# rule it follows: **the module supplies defaults, it imposes nothing.**
#
# Its own file since `ISS-004`, for the reason `host/guard.nix`'s `tools` and
# `host/cli.nix`'s `moduleState` are: the thing tying this to a host is an
# argument, so `wrapCases` can build the *shipped* builder against a fixture
# instead of re-rendering four export lines that would then agree with
# themselves while disagreeing with `host/services.nix`.
#
# **Why it is wrapped at all.** These programs' own defaults are relative to
# `CAPSULE_ROOT`, which is right for the foreground path and wrong for a program
# on `$PATH` — run from anywhere, `capsule-collect` would quarantine into
# `$PWD/.vm/host` instead of this host's state directory. The devshell's copies
# come first on PATH inside the repo, so that path is unaffected and each keeps
# its own state. (The same trap `capsule-sync` fell into; NOTES item 11.)
#
# **Why a default and not an assignment.** A bare `export` here is the last line
# before the program starts, so it defeats *any* caller that set the variable
# deliberately — including the caller this module installs. `host/cli.nix`'s
# `slotProfileName` resolves which document a verb on a slot reads and exports
# `CAPSULE_PROFILE_DIR` for it; until `ISS-004` the wrapper overwrote that with
# the host's directory, which made the profile pin inert for `collect`,
# `provision`, `brief` and `adopt` while `baseline` and `refresh` — unwrapped,
# and so inheriting the export — read the pin. Two verbs on one slot disagreed
# about which document that slot runs, and nothing said so.
#
# The programs one layer down are all written for the override already —
# `profileDir()` is `''${CAPSULE_PROFILE_DIR:-<baked>}` (host/profile.nix),
# `quarantineOf` reads `''${CAPSULE_STATE:-…}` (host/quarantine.nix) — so this
# file taking a value away was the only thing stopping a caller from being heard.
#
# **Four, and `CAPSULE_REPO` is not one of them** (SL-001, `ISS-008`). This is
# not the exception table rejected below. Each of the four has a *baked* fallback
# that a program on `$PATH` would get wrong — `$PWD`-relative state, the store's
# documents — so a default here corrects it. `capsule-provision`'s
# `src="''${CAPSULE_REPO:-$profile_path}"` (host/git-channel.nix) falls back to a
# value read from the document the front end just resolved, which is already
# right. A default in front of that is a second answer, and it pushed one
# target's checkout under another's refs. A caller who exports `CAPSULE_REPO`
# still wins; nothing here supplies it.
#
# **No exception table.** The alternative considered and rejected at `ISS-004`,
# when there were five, was to make `CAPSULE_PROFILE_DIR` and `CAPSULE_REPO`
# defaults and leave the other three imposed. It needs a defensible reason per
# variable and a maintained exception, and the two hazards it was for dissolve on inspection:
# `CAPSULE_STATE` already moves the quarantine and not the record on the
# devshell path, deliberately (`mem.fact.oubliette.capsule-state-moves-the-quarantine-not-the-record`),
# so one rule makes that one behaviour instead of a path-dependent one; and an
# overridden `CAPSULE_ALLOWLIST_DIR` makes a policy verb write a symlink the
# proxy does not read, which fails *closed* — the perimeter is unchanged, since
# the proxy unit takes its allowlist from `cfg.allowlistDir` at build
# (host/services.nix) and no environment reaches it. Both are reached only by a
# deliberate export, and both are pinned as cases.
