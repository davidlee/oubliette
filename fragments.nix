# The fragment vocabulary — what a guest may be composed out of, and the only
# place a tool that belongs to no project is allowed to be named.
#
# [docs/contract-flavour.md](./docs/contract-flavour.md) is the design and this
# is its build-time half: a flavour is `compose(floor, extras)`, the **floor** is
# the project's (its target's `toolsPackage` and `extraTools`, threaded through
# `vm/capsule.nix` as it always was) and the **extras** are the host operator's,
# drawn from a vocabulary the host declares. This file is that vocabulary;
# `extras` in `flake.nix` is the selection. Neither owner can quietly become the
# other, which is the whole reason the two lists are separate files.
#
# Three rules it exists to keep, all of them the contract's:
#
#   - **Convenience is declared, never inherited.** A fragment that copied this
#     human's dotfiles would describe a machine the capsule is not, and would be
#     a channel for host state into a confinement whose claim is that no host
#     directory gets in. Everything below is spelled out here or it does not
#     exist in the guest.
#   - **A fragment source is a flake input of this repo**, pinned in a lock this
#     host owns, so adding a tool source is a deliberate act with a rebuild
#     behind it (NOTES item 26).
#   - **A tool that is target-shaped does not come here.** The smell is the same
#     one CLAUDE.md names: a toolchain's name outside `targets/`. `rg` and
#     `tmux` are nobody's project, which is exactly why a target's file is the
#     wrong home for them.
#
# Two things deliberately absent, so neither reads as an oversight:
#
#   - **Capability fragments.** The contract's fragment is packages *plus*
#     guest capability, and `programs.nix-ld` is the standing example — but that
#     one is already decided the other way: every non-nix-native toolchain needs
#     it identically, so it belongs in what the capsule *supplies*, beside
#     `TMPDIR` and the caches (NOTES item 23). Nothing else has asked, so the
#     shape here is `{packages = …;}` — an attrset rather than a bare list,
#     which is where a `guestModule` goes the day something wants one.
#   - **Per-slot selection.** `extras` is one list for the fleet, so every slot
#     arrives at one composition and the one-image lever is untouched (NOTES
#     item 21). Selection per assignment — and with it the record's `image`, the
#     gcroot that retains it, and the refusal to change a composition under a
#     dirty volume — is Plan D D7. This file is what that would select *from*.
