# Contract — what a slot is assigned, and who may say so

**Part of this is built now.** `doctrine backlog list` and `doctrine knowledge
list` own the present tense and are where to read what; this file stays the shape
rather than the report. It was
fixed *before* [Plan D](./plan-d-fleet.md) D1 wrote a persistent record, because a
record is the most likely place for today's one-target assumptions to survive a
transition that was meant to remove them — and that worked: what D1 had to decide
on top of it was four questions about *mechanism*, answered from rules this repo
already had, and no field moved
([item 29](./ledger/029-the-record-is-front-end-written.md)).

**The policy noun is built now, and it is the second field an assignment
actually writes.** [Item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md) is
the mechanism: `policies.nix` is the host's vocabulary, `capsules.nix` gives each
slot a declared default and the set an assigner may select within, and `capsule
<slot> policy <name>` writes the record. Two things this file's shape had to
decide on contact with an implementation, both settled the way it says:

- **the record is not what the perimeter reads.** The proxy would have to become
  a reader of the assignment record, which is a hardened unit gaining a reason to
  see host state. The verb re-points a per-slot symlink instead, under the same
  `flock` as the record — the front end resolves, a program never probes;
- **live costs a proxy restart, and it is stated rather than hidden.** The proxy
  renders its config at start, so a selection reaches a running capsule when its
  proxy restarts, and that slot's egress drops for the length of it.

Two things D1 settled that this file states differently, both deliberate:

- **the path is `/var/lib/capsule/slot/<slot>/`**, not `/var/lib/capsule/<slot>/`
  as the table below has it. The state root already holds `collect/` and a slot
  called `collect` is a legal name, so one namespacing directory replaces a list
  of reserved words that nothing would remind anyone to extend;
- **`base.oid` is measured, not resolved.** This file says nothing resolves
  against `base.ref` twice; the implementation goes further and resolves it *zero*
  times host-side, reading the guest's `HEAD` after a successful provision
  instead. The commit a capsule is working on is the only commit an assignment can
  honestly claim to have pinned.

**No version numbers.** The shape is in negotiation between this repo and
doctrine, and a version is a compatibility promise neither can make yet. What is
frozen instead is the *split by authority* below — the field list will move and
the owners should not.

This is a governing artifact for both repos. This repo executes an assignment;
doctrine drives one ([contract-doctrine.md](./contract-doctrine.md)). A repo
being confined does not read any of it — that is
[contract-target.md](./contract-target.md), and its floor is the client-facing
half of the same design. The guest's capability set is
[contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md).

## The nouns, and who owns each

Plan D §6 named five; two more came out of "target", and
[item 25](./ledger/025-assignment-is-a-perimeter-verb.md) is why that mattered.
**The split is by authority, not by where the value happens to live today.** Two
values in the same file with different owners is the shape of every coupling
this repo has already had to undo once.

| noun | what it decides | owner | when it changes | who may change it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **slot** | identity, namespace, uplink /30, socket, units | host declaration (`capsules.nix`) | host rebuild | host operator |
| **flavour** | the guest's capability and tool closure | **not declared — composed** from the profile's floor and the assignment's extras ([contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md)) | stop, build, start — a symlink re-point, not a rebuild of the fleet | both owners, within a fragment vocabulary the host declares |
| **class** | machine config: `mem`, `vcpu` | the runner's JSON | stop / start | host operator declares; an assigner selects within the slot's set |
| **policy** | egress allowlist, ingestion bounds, whether this slot may collect | host declaration, *selected* by the assignment | live — see the refresh rule | host operator declares the set; an assigner selects within it, or is refused |
| **profile** | project semantics: baseline, caches, static guest config, tool floor, display identity | host-held, keyed by name | pinned per assignment generation | an assigner names it; until one does, the host operator's per-slot declaration in `capsules.nix` answers, with no set beside it (SL-001) |
| **source** | where *this host* has the profile's repo | the profile document's `path`, pinned with the profile | pinned per assignment generation | host operator only — never an assigner |
| **assignment** | binds a slot to profile + policy + class + extras + base commit + purpose | `/var/lib/capsule/<slot>/` | run time, free unless the composition is unbuilt | an assigner |
| **volume** | everything mutable: checkout, `$HOME`, caches, build tree, host keys | the volume | verbs (Plan D D3); size fixed at creation | host operator |

Six consequences worth stating rather than deriving:

- **`source` is a seventh noun because a path is not a project.**
  `/home/david/dev/doctrine` describes where this host happens to keep a
  checkout, not anything about the project — and the difference becomes visible
  as soon as there is more than one host, more than one checkout, or a
  controller working from its own clone. A profile is location-independent; the
  host holds a `profile → source` binding beside it, and since SL-001 a slot
  pins that binding with the rest of the document at provision, so a moved
  checkout is ordinary document drift until the slot is re-provisioned.
  `path` already half-admits this by having a host-side override
  (`CAPSULE_REPO`) that nothing else in `target.nix` has. There were two until
  the module's `repo` option went (`ISS-008`), and that one pushed every
  target from one checkout.

  **And it must not be assigner-controlled**, which is the sharper half.
  `capsule-provision` reads that repo *as the human* — it is the one program
  that touches the real source
  ([item 11](./ledger/011-host-side-runs-as-you.md)) — so an assigner free to
  name a path has a local-repository read primitive with a delivery mechanism
  attached. Host-declared, selected by profile
  name and pinned at provision, never spelled by whoever assigns.
- **There is no work-branch field anywhere.** The guest's branch is `work`,
  fixed, a capsule constant beside the volume's mount point. If a branch name
  identifies *the work* then it is not project state — two slices against one
  project settle that immediately — and it is not assignment state either,
  because `capsule-collect` already namespaces what comes back as
  `refs/capsule/<slot>/*` and whatever names the result outside this repo can
  name it there. Deleting the field entirely is the version of this decision
  that survives the second slice.

- **`flavour` is the one noun with no single owner, by design.** A project
  declares a *floor* — what it cannot be built or tested without — and an
  assigner adds *extras* on top; the image is what those compose to. So there is
  nothing to name and nothing to select, and the question the earlier draft
  asked — profile or assignment? — dissolves into both, in different halves.
  What that costs is that a novel composition is a build; whether `assign` may
  wait for one, or must refuse, is a per-host declaration
  ([contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md)).
- **`class` is `mem` and `vcpu` only.** Volume size is a `truncate` applied at
  first boot and never again (Plan D §5), so a class that included it would let
  an assignment claim a size its disk was not created with. Storage is a
  property of the volume; a class is a runner argument.

  **And a class is cheap only over reservations the assigned profile derives
  nothing from.** `mem` is runner-only, settled by eval. `vcpu` is not, for
  doctrine, because its profile renders `jobs` from the declared vCPU count into
  static guest config — so that class change is a new image
  ([item 27](./ledger/027-a-class-is-not-always-a-kilobyte.md)). Cheapness is a
  predicate over a *(class, profile)* pair, never a global fact, and a
  `class → cost` table stated once for the host would be wrong for the second
  profile. Nothing new is needed to *handle* it: the assignment already
  identifies its image by resolved store path, so a class change that re-renders
  derived config is already an image change and is already caught by the reuse
  rule.

  **This does not make resources something projects know nothing about.** Two
  concepts, and only the second is designed here: a project's *requirements or
  recommendations* — can this sensibly build in `small`? — and the host's
  *grant*. Today's `sizes` is both at once, which is why removing it from the
  target reads as losing information. Leave room for `profile.requirements`, or
  a compatibility predicate over a class, and do not design it before a client
  asks a question that needs it. It is the same floor-and-grant shape the tool
  set just got: the project states what it cannot do without, the host decides
  what it gets.
- **`policy` is not a property of a project.** An allowlist is a control, and a
  control chosen by whoever names the project is a control the naming authority
  holds ([item 25](./ledger/025-assignment-is-a-perimeter-verb.md)). The
  permissive answer — one slot, every policy — is a *declaration* a dev host may
  make, never the mechanism's default.
- **`profile` is data at run time.** Whether a profile is authored in nix and
  rendered to JSON in a directory, or written there directly, is a question
  about *who may author one* and not about a file format. This repo authors
  them in nix because that is what it has; the interface the programs read is a
  validated document in a directory, so a controller that never runs
  `nixos-rebuild` remains possible. `perimeter/egress-allow.txt` is the
  precedent already in the tree: a plain file rather than a store path, exactly
  so that changing it is not a build.

## The assignment

What a slot is currently supposed to be. Desired state, host-authored,
never read by the guest.

| field | what | why it is a field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generation` | monotonic integer, per slot, bumped by every mutation | what makes a late answer refusable. Without it a worker that returns after a re-assign operates on a slot that is no longer the one it was given |
| `schema` | serialization discriminator, `1` to start | persistent state outlives the binary that wrote it. **Not a compatibility promise** — the design in this file is deliberately unversioned, and a number on the bytes is a different thing from a number on the contract |
| `profile` | name of a project profile | the semantics half of what used to be "target". Absent means the slot's declared `profile` in `capsules.nix` answers, when it has one — the host operator's convenience for an unassigned slot, with **no set** beside it, since an assigner is unconstrained here (below) — and otherwise the only document in the profile directory (SL-001) |
| `profile_snapshot` | **the profile document itself**, retained here, addressed by its digest | see the retention rule below. A digest alone cannot answer "reapply what was pinned" once the named document has changed. **Built** ([item 52](./ledger/052-the-document-leaves-the-store.md) step 3): a provision copies the document it was taken under to `<slot>/profile/<name>.json` and records that copy's `sha256:…`; every later verb on the slot reads *those* bytes, because the front end points `CAPSULE_PROFILE_DIR` at that directory. Absent means the slot reads whatever the host declares now, which is what every record said before that step |
| `policy` | name of a policy, from the slot's declared set | the control half. Separate field because separate owner (item 25). **Built** ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)): written by `capsule <slot> policy <name>`, refused outside that slot's set, and read by two things — the slot's allowlist link, re-pointed in the same locked write, and `capsule-collect`'s `--policy`, which the front end fills from here. Absent means the slot runs the operator's declared default, because absence is not a state a perimeter may be in |
| `extras` | fragments composed on top of the profile's floor, from the slot's declared vocabulary | the assigner's half of what the guest can do. The profile declares a *floor* and never a flavour; the image is `compose(floor, extras)` ([contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md)) |
| `image` | **the store path** the composition resolved to, with a gcroot holding it | the resolved identity of `floor + extras`. Fragment names re-resolve when the vocabulary's inputs relock; a store path does not |
| `class` | `mem`, `vcpu` | runner config |
| `base.ref` | what the human or the client asked for | provenance and display only. Nothing resolves against it twice |
| `base.oid` | the commit that ref resolved to at assignment time | **the authoritative one.** A ref moves; an assignment must not silently move with it, and every later comparison — dirty, ahead, is-this-a-valid-clone-source — is arithmetic on a commit |
| `unit` | the unit of work this slot is driving, as one opaque token | **the scope of the exhibit**, and the reason it is not `purpose`. The profile's `statePaths` is a template with one `{unit}` in it and this fills the hole, so unlike every other field here it reaches a *path* — hence bounded to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` and not `.` or `..`, and hence validated on the way in rather than on the way out ([item 32](./ledger/032-the-sideband-channel.md)). Present only where the profile has a hole for it: a field nothing reads is a field that will one day be believed. Written by `capsule <slot> unit <token>` and, since [item 53](./ledger/053-three-coarse-verbs.md)'s verb 1, by `capsule <slot> setup <ref> --unit <token>` — the act that assigns a slot is the moment the field is about, and the checks are the same ones because they are one function |
| `purpose` | free text | **opaque here, always.** Whatever a client puts in it is the client's; this repo displays it and never parses it. The same rule as `baseline` being a command line and not a build system. It says what the slot is *for*; `unit` says what its exhibit is *of*, which is why one is a sentence and the other a token. Written by `capsule <slot> purpose <text>`, by `setup --purpose <text>`, and required by `handoff`, which will not guess one |

### One shape, three times: a name plus a resolved identity

`base.ref` / `base.oid` is the shape `capsule-provision` already implies —
`<ref>` is any commit-ish and deliberately undefaulted
([contract-target.md](./contract-target.md)) — made durable. The same pairing
appears twice more, and noticing that it is one rule rather than three
conveniences is what keeps the record honest:

| what was asked for | what is recorded and used |
| --- | --- |
| `base.ref` — a branch or tag in the source repo | `base.oid`, a commit |
| `profile` — a name in a directory | `profile_snapshot`, the bytes |
| `extras` + the profile's floor — fragment names | `image`, a store path |

**A digest is verification; pinning also requires retention.** Every left-hand
column is a *name that re-resolves*: a branch moves, `profiles/foo.json` gets
edited, and a fragment name means something new after `nix flake update`. So
"reapply the pinned generation" must mean *use exactly these bytes and exactly
this image*, never *look those names up again and hope the digest matches*. A
digest detects the drift it cannot undo.

Both retentions are cheap and one of them is already built:

- **the profile snapshot** is a small document written into the slot's directory
  at assign time. No store, no indirection — the assignment carries its own copy
  and the digest is over that copy.
- **the image** is held by a gcroot, which is how microvm.nix already works: a
  slot's binding to a nix artefact is the `current` and `booted` symlinks in its
  state directory, read from source in [Plan D](./plan-d-fleet.md) §5. The
  assignment records the path; the gcroot keeps it.

**Retention is for the current assignment, not for history.** Nothing holds a
superseded generation's image, because re-assignment already resets the volume
and a restorable previous generation is a thing this design does not offer.
Saying so keeps the gcroot count equal to the slot count instead of growing with
every re-assign.

**And nothing holds a superseded generation's snapshot either**, which this file
first said the other way round. As built ([item
52](./ledger/052-the-document-leaves-the-store.md) step 3) there is **one pin per
slot**: a re-provision replaces the bytes and leaves nothing of the document
before them. Keeping the old bytes would be provenance for a *record* nothing
keeps — the assignment document is one file, rewritten in place with the
generation bumped, and there has never been a copy of the generation it
superseded. A snapshot beside a record that no longer exists is a file whose
generation cannot be read off anything, which is the shape a stale name here
already costs elsewhere. Whichever way history is kept, it is kept for the record
first and the snapshot with it.

## The observed status

What is actually true, as distinct from what was asked for. Everything below is
a *measurement*, taken host-side, and none of it is authoritative about intent.

| field | how it is read |
| --- | --- |
| `applied_generation` | which assignment the volume's contents actually reflect. Not equal to `generation` means a pending or failed apply, which is a state and not an error |
| `head_oid`, `dirty`, `ahead` | one ssh round trip into the checkout |
| `baseline` | verdict and age, **read from the record on the volume, never from an exit status** — `capsule-baseline` writes the record before the shell that runs it can lose the status (Plan D D5, [item 24](./ledger/024-set-u-not-login-shell.md)) |
| `session` | whether anything is attached or detached in there (Plan D D6) |
| `disk` | `df` on the volume — the fleet's binding constraint (Plan D L8, [probes](./probes.md#figures)) |
| `memory` | current and peak. Peak because nothing hands memory back until a stop, so `stop` is a resource verb and a human needs to know which idle slot to reap |

Keeping these two objects apart is most of the value of writing this file
down. A record that mixes them cannot answer *is this slot doing what it was
told* — which is the one question an administered fleet is for.

## The refresh rule

**A profile is pinned; a policy is live.** Different owners, different clocks:

- Reapplying a slot's payloads reapplies **the profile generation the assignment
  pinned**, not whatever the latest profile document says. Build semantics
  belong to the assignment, and an edit to a project's caches or its baseline
  changing what a running capsule is doing — with no verb run against that
  capsule — is the reproducibility failure this repo already avoids elsewhere by
  making `guestConfig` a symlink into the store rather than a copy.
- A **policy** takes effect on its own terms, because a tightening must reach a
  running capsule without anyone re-assigning it. A widening is a host
  operator's act by construction, since only the operator may edit the declared
  set.

Plan D §6.3 had one rule — refresh-always — for both, which is right for the
property it was protecting (no stale copy outliving the sizes it was rendered
from) and wrong about which document it re-reads. The generic capability is *a
payload declaration says whether it is pinned or live*, which is one field on
the declaration rather than two mechanisms
([item 22](./ledger/022-secrets-at-start.md) already needed a field of the same
kind for write-if-absent versus derived).

## States, and what makes a slot reusable

`unassigned → provisioned(oid) → baselined(oid) → dirty`, and the transition
into `dirty` is mechanical: worktree dirty, `head_oid != base.oid`, `$HOME`
touched since the baseline, or an interactive session opened.

**Reuse across an ownership change is a trust question, not a
cache-compatibility one.** A volume carries the previous assignment's caches,
build tree, `$HOME`, injected credentials and ssh host keys. Under a new
project or policy,
those are not stale garbage — they are *input supplied by a different
principal*, and a build that reads them is a build the new owner did not
specify. So:

- changing `profile` or `policy`, or arriving at a different `image`, on a
  non-clean volume is **refused**, with `--reset` as the answer. The check is on
  the resolved identity and not on a name, so adding one extra fragment counts
  and nobody has to remember that it should;
- a dev host may waive that by declaration, which is Plan D §0's two-modes rule
  again;
- a clone's identity is scrubbed by default and kept only under an explicit flag
  (Plan D D4): `capsule <dest> volume clone-from <src>` leaves a marker, and the
  front end scrubs before any inject while it is there (`--identity` to keep);
- a slot is a valid clone *source* while it is `baselined` and not yet `dirty` —
  which is also the cheapest source, since a volume's allocation is its
  high-water mark and never its current usage (Plan D L8). **This rule is not
  enforced.** `clone-from` needs the source stopped, and every signal behind the
  rule is read through the guest, so it takes any stopped declared slot
  (`DEC-007`), says it did not check, and prints the recipe for checking by hand.
  Enforcing it stays with `IMP-001`; showing it in status is `IMP-008`.

**One refusal, two different reasons, and they should not be conflated even
though the behaviour is currently the same.** A change of `profile` or `policy`
is a **provenance** boundary: different owner, different perimeter, and the
previous occupant's bytes are another principal's input. A change of `image` is
mostly a **compatibility** one: a cache built by one toolchain is meaningless to
another. Adding `neovim` to the extras crosses the second and not the first, and
treating it as an ownership transition is safely conservative rather than
correct. D1 should refuse on both — the conservative answer is right while there
is nothing to distinguish them with — and should not write down that they are
the same event, because the compatibility half can eventually get a cheaper
answer (a floor change matters, a pure superset of extras may not) and the
provenance half never can.

The mechanism belongs here. The *policy* about what may be reused is the
client's.

## Concurrency

One host, ten slots, and a generation integer: the discipline is a `flock` on
the slot's directory for any mutation, and a read-modify-write that checks the
generation it read is the generation it is replacing. Nothing more elaborate is
warranted at this size, and anything more elaborate would be inventing a
control plane this repo has repeatedly declined to build
([plan-c-multi-capsule.md](./plan-c-multi-capsule.md), "No daemon").

What the generation buys is worth naming precisely, because it is not
concurrency in the usual sense: **any command that acts on a slot states the
generation it is acting for, and is refused if that is not current.** Without
detached work that is bookkeeping. With it (Plan D D6, and anything
`capsule-run`-shaped) it is the difference between a stale worker reporting into
the slot it was given and reporting into whatever that slot has since become.

## Who may assign

Trivial on a dev machine, where every repo and every slot is the same human's.
It stops being trivial the moment a program assigns, and the answer this file
commits to is narrow on purpose:

**an assigner is unconstrained in `profile`, `base` and `purpose`, and
constrained to a declared set in `policy`, `class` and `extras`.** The first
three are semantics and are what delegation is *for*; the last three are
controls, resources and guest code, and a set is what makes "this slot may be
handed to anyone" a thing a host operator states rather than a thing that is
true because nobody thought about it.

The profile's *floor* is not in either list, and that is deliberate: it belongs
to the project, arrives pinned with the profile, and an assigner names a profile
rather than editing one. What an assigner adds is extras, from the vocabulary.

## What is deliberately not here

**Execution.** There is no request/result shape in this file, and the omission
is current rather than permanent. Two reasons, and the second is the one that
matters: doctrine does not want to care about it yet, and when it does the angle
is likely to be different in kind — an outbox that a capsule fills and a host
notices, rather than a synchronous verb that returns a verdict.

That difference is not cosmetic, and it is why writing the contract early would
be worse than leaving it open. A notification model is *guest-initiated*, which
is exactly where [item 18](./ledger/018-git-channel-direction.md)'s invariant
would be quietly given up: the host initiates both directions, and the guest
has no channel out. An outbox the host *polls* over the door it already has
keeps that; a doorbell the guest *rings* does not, whatever it is implemented
with. Anyone drafting this later starts there.

What the assignment does owe any such shape, and already carries, is
`generation` — a run states which assignment it was for, and a result that
arrives late is refusable rather than misattributed. When the shape settles it
belongs in a generic execution contract, not inside doctrine's file: doctrine
being the first consumer is not a reason for the mechanism to be its
(contract-doctrine.md, Role 3).
