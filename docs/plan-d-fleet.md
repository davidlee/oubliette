# Plan D — the fleet: capsules across projects, refs and slices

Scoping, not commitment, and the second of the two things the work is now
directed by. The first is doctrine's needs for capsule-based execution
([contract-doctrine.md](./contract-doctrine.md)); this file is the other one —
*what it is like to run several capsules, across more than one project, on one
host*, and which of that the current design makes cheap, dear or impossible.

Plan C asked whether N capsules can run at once and priced the mechanism. They
can, and it holds at N=2 ([status](./status.md)). This asks the question that
follows and that Plan C left out: **N capsules are an inventory, and an
inventory has to be administered** — assigned, re-assigned, inspected, recycled,
thrown away.

Limitations here are structural: consequences of where a value lives, not of
what has been built yet. Where something is merely unrun, this says so and links
to `doctrine backlog list` and `doctrine knowledge list`, which own the present
tense.

## 0. Settled

Decided in conversation, so the rest of the file can lean on it. Not built.

- **Slots are abstract and pre-declared.** `a`…`j`, roughly ten, four to six hot
  at once. A slot's name carries no meaning, which is what makes an assignment
  record necessary rather than nice.
- **`sizes.mem` drops to 6144, and the reason is the fleet rather than the
  measurement.** [probes](./probes.md#what-a-capsule-costs-to-work-in) argued
  the other way at N=1 — *"Not cut to 6 GiB on n = 1… a generous declaration
  costs nothing until something touches it"* — and that argument is sound and
  expires here: a ceiling is free per capsule and a reservation per fleet,
  because nothing hands it back until a stop. What the cut is **not** justified
  by is 4513 MiB. That is a guest-side peak inside a `MemoryMax=7G` scope, which
  excludes the guest kernel, sshd, the RAM-backed journal and the tmpfs root — a
  scope figure read against a VM ceiling. The term the fleet is arithmetic on is
  the *unit's* cgroup peak: 7169 / 7510 / 7774 / 6801 / 7845 MiB across five
  cold builds, and once **8365 against a declared 8192**, where the +173 MiB is
  host page cache for the VMM's image and volume reads — charged to the unit,
  reclaimable, with `memory.events` zero throughout. ~~So a slot costs `mem` plus
  ~0.2 GiB observed, and six at 6144 is ~36-37 GiB.~~

  **Struck — the cut is free but it is not a saving, and the arithmetic above is
  the part that was wrong.** A built slot holds ~6.1 GiB of `anon` at *either*
  ceiling (6141 of 8192, 6095 of 6144), because the VMM holds every distinct page
  the build ever touched rather than a share of what the guest was offered
  ([probes](./probes.md#the-first-cold-build-at-a-6144-ceiling)). Two things
  follow. **`mem` is not a term in what a slot costs** until it drops below the
  workload's touched footprint, at which point it stops being free and starts
  squeezing the guest — 6144 did not, and nothing says where that boundary is.
  And **`+0.2 GiB` was one instance, not a constant**: the page-cache half has
  read 173, 965 and 1493 MiB, so the honest form is ~6.1 GiB of hard `anon` plus
  0.2-1.5 GiB of reclaimable cache. Six hot is therefore ~45 GiB by the same
  addition, worse than the 36-37 it replaces — **but that addition is itself
  suspect**, because one guest image means the cache pages are largely the *same*
  pages, charged to whichever slot faulted them first, and summing them per slot
  double-counts. That is the measurement N=2-at-6144 would settle and no run has.
- **Four hot is the recommendation, and now for a different reason.** Not
  because six fits the arithmetic — the arithmetic above is withdrawn — but
  because the term that binds was never `mem`: this host had **13.1 GiB available
  with both capsules idle** and ordinary work running, and an idle built capsule
  holds ~6.1 GiB of `anon` while the guest inside it reports a few hundred MiB
  used ([probes](./probes.md#what-a-capsule-holds-after-it-has-built)) — the
  ratchet, which only a stop closes and which a smaller ceiling does not shorten.
  Four is the number with evidence under it; what would move it is a hot-slot
  count measured directly, not a per-slot figure multiplied.
- **`~/flakes` takes this repo locally.** The `github:davidlee/oubliette` input
  exists so darwin can evaluate the flake, not because the host wants a round
  trip; Sleipnir overrides it with `git+file:///home/david/dev/microvm-spike` at
  rebuild time. Not `path:`, which copies the working tree unfiltered and would
  drag `.vm/`'s volume images into the store. Class 3 below becomes commit →
  switch.
- **The existing capsules are expendable.** `capsule` and `capsule-b` get
  renamed into slots rather than special-cased.
- **Two modes, one mechanism.** This host is a dev machine and can be
  permissive; a future agent-ranch cannot. Nothing here may bake the permissive
  answer in as the architecture — it has to fall out as a declaration.
- **Longer term, a slot has a class**, EC2-shaped: `small`, `high-cpu`, and
  perhaps a role (`worker`, `auditor`). Noted as a goal, deliberately not chased
  here — but see §6 for the two ways to get it wrong.

## 1. What varies per capsule, and what cannot

| axis | where it lives | cost to change it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name, index, namespace, socket, uplink /30 | `capsules.nix` | host rebuild (class 3) |
| base commit | argument to `capsule-provision` | seconds, no rebuild |
| everything on the volume — checkout, `$HOME`, caches, `target/`, ssh host keys, `.env`, baseline record | per instance, created by microvm.nix | no verb at all (L4) |
| secret payload *content* | `~/.config/capsule/<name>.env`, per capsule by filename | `capsule <n> inject env --force` |
| secret payload *declaration* | `setup.nix` | host rebuild |
| **target repo** | `inputs.target.url` + `target.nix`, **global** | one image at a time, and switching is a branch (L1) |
| tool set | the target's own flake | guest rebuild + `microvm -u` per capsule |
| `defaultBranch` | interpolated into `capsule-provision` and into the guest's seed | host rebuild, and **no run-time override exists** (L13) |
| sizes (vcpu, mem, volume) | `target.nix`, **global** | class 2 — but they are in the runner, not the image; §5 (L2) |
| allowlist *content* | a plain file | edit + `systemctl restart capsule-proxy-<n>` |
| allowlist *file* (a different one per capsule) | `services.capsule-perimeter.allowlist`, one for the host | host rebuild (L3) |
| what the capsule is *for* | nowhere (L5) | — |

The pattern: **the base commit is the only axis deliberately made a run-time
value** (NOTES item 18, Plan C item 2), and it is the only one that moves
without a rebuild. Everything else about a capsule's identity is declared in
this repo or baked into the guest closure. Right for one capsule; it is what the
fleet runs into.

## 2. The rebuild classes

Five, and knowing which one a change lands in is most of the administrative
cost:

0. **Run time, no build.** `provision`, `inject`, `collect`, `fetch`, `start`,
   `stop`, `ssh`, `admin`, `baseline`; editing `perimeter/egress-allow.txt` plus
   a proxy restart. Seconds.
1. **Local `just build`.** The devshell's copies of the host programs.
2. **Guest image.** `nix build .#capsule`, then `sudo microvm -u <name>` for
   *each* capsule and a restart, because a created VM tracks its state directory
   and not the flake (CLAUDE.md). Triggered by `vm/*`, by `target.nix`'s `sizes`
   / `caches` / `guestConfig` / `extraTools` — `sizes` **perhaps** only
   rebuilding the runner rather than the image, which is §5's inference and §9's
   step 2 — and by `nix flake update target` — which needs a *commit in the
   target repo* first (`git+file:` reads committed HEAD).
3. **Host rebuild.** Anything in `host/`, `setup.nix` declarations, and
   `capsules.nix`. ~~Until the §0 override, also a push~~ — **the override is
   taken** (L11), so this is commit → switch: `~/flakes` used to take the module
   from GitHub, and declaring a capsule then meant commit → push → `nix flake
   update oubliette` → `nixos-rebuild switch`. It reads **committed HEAD** at the
   overridden path, so the commit is not optional.
4. **Create / update the instance.** `just up <name>` (`microvm -c`) needs *this
   checkout*, because the instance name resolves as a flake attribute (NOTES
   item 21); `microvm -u <name>` after every class-2 change.

The two heaviest are the two the fleet leans on hardest: **declaring a capsule
is class 3**, and **pointing a capsule at a different project is class 2 + 4** —
and class 3 too, if it is also a new instance. The cheapest axis, base commit,
is the one that already got the treatment. §5 and §6 are about giving the others
the same treatment, and §5 is why that is affordable.

## 3. User stories

Each is a thing a human wants to do on a Tuesday. `today:` is what happens now.

**S1 — a new project arrives.** A capsule confining `~/dev/otherthing`,
alongside the doctrine ones. *today:* **alongside, no; instead of, yes and it
has been done.** panopticon is confined on branch `second-target` — cold-green
on a brand-new allowlist, 3 s and 105 MiB of volume
([item 23](./ledger/023-second-target.md),
[probes](./probes.md#the-cold-build-on-a-second-target)) — so the port is priced
rather than hypothetical. What is not possible is *both at once*: one
`inputs.target.url` literal, one `target.nix`, one `capsuleVm`, and every
declared capsule bound to that same value, so the switch is a branch and a
class-2/3 chain. (L1)

**S2 — two slices of one project at once.** Two capsules on doctrine, different
base commits, different slices. *today:* works, and is measured — two capsules,
two base commits, both cold-baselined green
([probes](./probes.md#two-cold-builds-at-once)). Collected refs are namespaced
`refs/capsule/<name>/*`, so `capsule all fetch` lands both in one repo without
collision — *between slots*, which is the case this story is about; a slot's own
successive assignments share that namespace and are
[item 50](./ledger/050-a-quarantine-outlives-its-assignment.md). The gap this
entry named is closed: `unit` and `purpose` are record fields and status columns
(D1), so which slice a capsule holds is answerable from the host. What remains is
the other half of L5 — neither prompt nor motd can say which capsule you are in
(NOTES item 21).

**S3 — rebase a capsule onto a newer base.** The branch moved; move the capsule
without losing its work. *today:* `capsule <n> collect` then `capsule <n>
provision <ref>`. Refused if the guest's worktree is dirty (`updateInstead`),
refused if it would discard guest commits; `--force` insists and discards them.
Right defaults, and **the deciding half is answerable now** that L6 is closed:
head, dirty and the collected refs are columns, and `capsule <n> branches` reads
what a quarantine holds. What is still missing is the *divergence* as one
reading — ahead/behind against the ref you are about to provision at — so the
safe sequence is two commands and a habit.

**S4 — throw one away and start clean.** This capsule is wedged; a fresh one
under the same name.
*today:* stop it, `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/microvms/<n>` out of band — destroying
the volume, checkout, `$HOME`, caches *and* ssh host keys — then `just up <n>`,
`just reset-known-hosts <n>`, `capsule <n> setup <ref>`, and pay ~109 s of cold
build. No verb, no partial reset, and the destructive step is a hand-typed
`rm -rf` under `/var/lib`. (L4, L7)

**S5 — warm start.** A new capsule already built, in seconds rather than two
minutes.
*today:* not possible, and how much it costs is target-shaped. On doctrine the
cold build is ~93% of time-to-interactive ([status](./status.md)); on panopticon
it is 3 s against an 8.31 s boot, so there the *boot* is the largest term
([probes](./probes.md#the-cold-build-on-a-second-target)). Nothing shares or
copies a volume either way. (L8)

**S6 — what is running?** Which capsules are up, what each is working on, is
anything stuck.
*today:* **answered by D5**, which is what closed L6. `capsule all status` adds
head, dirty, baseline verdict and age, `df /work`, current-versus-peak memory,
collected refs, generation, policy, unit and purpose to the host-side columns it
always had, plus the guard as the witness for what is inside a namespace. The
one question in the original list still outside it is *is an agent running in
there*, which is L9's shape rather than a column's — see D6.

**S7 — reset just `$HOME`.** The agent's own state is confused; keep the
checkout and the caches. *today:* not possible short of destroying the volume.
`$HOME` is `/work/home` on the same volume as everything else, so the axes
cannot be separated. (L7)

**S8 — leave an agent running and come back.** Start an agent in slot C, close
the laptop, reattach later; do that for three capsules. *today:* an agent runs
in an interactive ssh session the human holds, and dies with the terminal.
`capsule-baseline` already solves this shape for a *build* — setsid, a record on
the volume, re-running attaches to the run in flight — but nothing generalises
it and an interactive agent needs a pty that pattern does not give. (L9)

**S9 — look at what it built.** The project has a dev server; put a browser on
it.
*today:* ad hoc, and it works — the door is ssh with a ProxyCommand, so
`ssh -L 3000:10.99.0.2:3000 …` forwards a port through the relay socket. But it
cannot be said through the CLI: `capsule <n> ssh` passes trailing arguments as
the *remote command*, so the ProxyCommand has to be reconstructed by hand. No
verb, no record of which capsule owns which host port, nothing stopping two
capsules from claiming the same one. (L10, and now
[item 48](./ledger/048-a-forwarded-port-is-host-state.md), which is where it is
tracked — the reach exists and the **allocation** is what is missing.)

**S10 — retire a capsule.** Done with it; give the host its resources back.
*today:* stop, delete the state dir by hand, remove the name from
`capsules.nix`, take the class-3 chain to make the units go away. Its quarantine
at `/var/lib/capsule/collect/<n>.git` is left behind and nothing reaps it —
[item 50](./ledger/050-a-quarantine-outlives-its-assignment.md), which is where
retention is tracked and which found the sharper half underneath it: the ref
namespace is the **slot's** and not the assignment's, so a slot's successive
assignments share one quarantine and the collect refspecs are forced. Deleting
the *name* is at least safe by design: indices are declared, so neighbours do
not renumber.

**S11 — a secret rotated.** The token on this host changed; running capsules
hold stale copies. *today:* `capsule <n> inject <payload> --force` per capsule,
and the force discards whatever the guest wrote there. Deliberate (NOTES item
22) — but an N-times ritual with no way to ask which capsules are stale.
Injection *at start* would make the ritual a restart, and it is built: `capsule
<name> start` waits for the guest to answer and injects the whole declared list,
which is only safe because every payload is write-if-absent (item 22). That
makes the *fresh* capsule cheap and leaves rotation exactly where item 22 left
it — deliberately manual, because refreshing at every start would silently
discard what the guest wrote N times.

**S12 — two projects with different dependency hosts.** One needs crates.io, the
other npm.
*today:* **solved by L3's closure** ([item
36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)). It used to be one allowlist
for every capsule on the host, so the union — a real widening of each capsule's
perimeter for the other's benefit. A policy is selected per slot now, so the two
projects take different ones and neither is widened for the other. What is left
is S1's problem and not this one: both capsules still run one target.

## 4. Limitations

Structural, numbered for citation. None is a bug; each is a place the design
bought something else.

- **L1 — one target per *image*, so one at a time on this host.** The target
  reaches the guest as a flake input literal, which cannot be computed, and
  every declared capsule is bound to one `capsuleVm` value so that "one image, N
  capsules" is structural rather than a promise (`flake.nix`, NOTES item 21). A
  second target is a second image: +3.0 GiB of erofs, its own tool set, its own
  allowlist, its own `target.nix`. Priced in
  [plan-c](./plan-c-multi-capsule.md#mixed-targets-defer-but-keep-it-possible);
  the cheap insurance it recommended — a `target` field on the instance record —
  **was not taken** then. SL-001 has since added one, `profile`, as a declared
  convenience rather than a binding: every slot declares `doctrine`, because
  this host builds one image and a slot declaring another target would boot it
  anyway (`DEC-016`). A per-slot split waits on a slot having its own image
  (`IMP-006`).

  What is no longer speculative is the *port*. panopticon is a second target on
  branch `second-target`, and it cost `target.nix` wholesale, one allowlist
  file, `inputs.target.url`, and **one guest capability** — nix-ld, which is now
  on this branch too because every non-nix-native toolchain needs it and none
  supplies a different value for it (NOTES item 23). Nothing generic changed. So
  the limitation is concurrency and the class-2/3 chain, not parameterisation:
  two targets on one host is `git switch` plus a rebuild, and two targets *at
  once* is D7.
- **L2 — sizes are global, and needn't be, but they are not uniformly cheap.**
  vcpu, mem and volume come from `target.nix` for every capsule alike. `mem`
  lives in the runner rather than the erofs, so per-slot memory costs a kilobyte
  — settled by eval in §5. `vcpu` does not: this target renders it into
  `guestConfig`, so per-slot vCPU is a 3.0 GiB image and a `microvm -u` per slot
  ([item 27](./ledger/027-a-class-is-not-always-a-kilobyte.md)). Volume size is
  fixed at first boot and is the volume's, not a class's.
- ~~**L3 — one allowlist per host, not per capsule.**~~ **Closed** ([item
  36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)), and by the shape §6
  predicted rather than the one this entry did. The prediction here was a
  per-capsule allowlist *field*; what landed is a **policy selected from a
  declared set** — the host declares the vocabulary and each slot declares which
  of it an assigner may pick, so the project never names its own perimeter (NOTES
  item 25). The module option is not singular any more and is not plural either:
  a `policyDir` holding every declared policy's file, and an `allowlistDir` of
  one symlink per slot which the proxy binds. Where that symlink *lives* was a
  second finding ([item 39](./ledger/039-a-bind-is-not-a-traversal.md)). The
  *naming* half this entry recorded is still in use:
  `perimeter/egress-allow-<target>.txt`, one file per target, with doctrine's
  plain `egress-allow.txt` grandfathered (NOTES item 23).
- **L4 — the volume has no verbs.** Created by microvm.nix, destroyed by
  `rm -rf`. Reset, clone, snapshot and size are all out-of-band operations on a
  path under `/var/lib/microvms`, where a typo is expensive.
- **L5 — a capsule has no purpose, and cannot say its own name.** **Half
  closed.** The purpose half is D1's: the assignment record carries `purpose`
  and `unit`, and both are status columns ([item
  29](./ledger/029-the-record-is-front-end-written.md)) — so what a capsule was
  assigned to is answerable from the host. The *name* half is untouched: one
  image means every guest still greets you as `agent@capsule` (NOTES item 21,
  knowingly paid), which at N=2 was already why two probe results were
  indistinguishable by prompt. §6's identity payload is where that half goes,
  and it is the cheaper half — a refresh-always `/work/.capsule`, not a second
  image.
- ~~**L6 — status stops at the door.**~~ **Closed by D5**, which is the one
  direction here built *before* the record it reads from, deliberately: the guest
  round trip is what settles where `base.oid` comes from. Every fact this entry
  named — commit, dirty, disk, baseline verdict and its age — is a column fed by
  the round trip `answers` already paid for, plus current-versus-peak memory,
  which the ratchet makes a steering number rather than a curiosity. *Is an agent
  running* is the exception and is not a column's problem: it is L9.
- **L7 — the volume's contents are one axis.** Checkout, `$HOME`, caches and
  `target/` share a lifetime because they share a disk, so freshness is
  all-or-nothing and "reset the agent's state" and "start over" are one
  operation.
- **L8 — every capsule pays the cold build.** On doctrine that is ~109 s and
  ~93% of time-to-interactive, per fresh volume, and nothing reuses another
  capsule's work — but the term is target-shaped, not the capsule's:
  panopticon's is 3 s against an 8.31 s boot, so nothing generic should be tuned
  against either ([probes](./probes.md#the-cold-build-on-a-second-target)). Two
  host constraints on any fix. `/var/lib` is **ext4, so there is no reflink** —
  a cloned volume is a real copy, against the host's own headroom, which
  [probes](./probes.md#figures) owns and no plan should spell twice. And because
  nothing discards, **a volume's allocation is its high-water mark, not its
  current usage** — an image that once held a 6.9 GiB untuned build still copies
  6.9 GiB after it is cleaned. So clone cost is a function of the source's
  *history*, which is a second argument for cloning from a base that was never
  worked in (D4) rather than from a peer. The host-level lever, if clones become
  routine: a btrfs subvolume for `/var/lib/microvms`, which makes them near-free
  — the runner already tries `chattr +C` for exactly that world, and it is a
  no-op on ext4.
- **L9 — no detached session.** An agent's life is an ssh session's life. The
  detach pattern exists (`host/baseline.nix`) but only for a non-interactive
  command.
- **L10 — no port forwarding as a first-class thing.** Possible by hand through
  the existing door; unmanaged, so nothing allocates or records host ports. **The
  only limitation here with no direction covering it**, which is why it is now
  [item 48](./ledger/048-a-forwarded-port-is-host-state.md) rather than a line in
  a table: the reach exists and the missing thing is allocation, which is
  host-side, belongs in the record, and is never the guest's to choose.
- ~~**L11 — declaring a capsule is a git push.**~~ **Closed** by §0's local
  input, which is why that was step one. Class 3 is commit → switch now; the
  GitHub round trip remains only so darwin can evaluate the flake, and reading
  **committed HEAD** at the overridden path is what replaced the push.
- ~~**L12 — one broken slot denies the whole host, and the chain that does it is
  not obvious.**~~ **Closed** ([item
  30](./ledger/030-a-pool-audits-what-exists.md)), which left the pool itself as
  D2's only remaining content — and **both halves of D2 have since landed**, the
  declaration
  ([30](./ledger/030-a-pool-audits-what-exists.md)) and the run-time selection
  ([36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)). The chain was: nothing
  in `host/services.nix` is
  `wantedBy` anything, so a start of `microvm@<name>` wants its proxy, the proxy
  `BindsTo` the guard — and the guard used to `requires` **every** declared
  namespace unit while auditing all of them every 10 s. A ten-slot pool therefore
  cost nothing at rest and all ten at once on the first start, and the failure
  that mattered was not an idle slot but a *broken* one: a namespace unit that
  refused took the guard with it, and through the guard's `BindsTo` **no capsule
  on the host could start** — not merely the broken one. Correct for a perimeter,
  and at N=2 indistinguishable from robust.

  What replaced it is not the exclusion list this item originally asked for. The
  guard `requires` only the aggregator, orders itself after the namespace units
  without pulling them in, and audits declared ∩ present — with a second limb
  saying every running capsule's VMM is inside its own namespace, which is what
  makes skipping an absent one sound. No new state, no mode, and a *broken*
  namespace is still fleet-wide.
- ~~**L13 — `defaultBranch` has no run-time override, and it is the odd one
  out.**~~ **Closed by deletion, and built** — `workBranch` is a constant in
  `flake.nix` threaded like any other value, so there is no field to override and
  §9 step 8's precondition ("neither flavours nor run-time assignment can ship
  while a program spells the branch") is met. The entry is kept because the
  *form* of the closure is the value — it is the only limitation here answered by
  removing a field rather than by adding a mechanism. What it was:
  every other host-side target value either belonged to the guest (`sizes`,
  `caches`, `guestConfig`) or had an override — `path` has `CAPSULE_REPO` and the
  module's `repo` option, `allowlist` had `CAPSULE_ALLOWLIST` and its own
  option. `defaultBranch` was interpolated straight into `capsule-provision`, so
  a target switch was a rebuild for that field alone, and until it was taken the
  module path's copy refused a provision of the new target's branch — correctly,
  and with a clear message (NOTES item 23). Recorded rather than fixed at the
  time, because switching targets was a rebuild anyway. §6.2 is where it stopped
  being harmless: target as run-time state cannot ship while a program spells the
  branch.

  **Decided: deletion, and nothing replaces it.** The guest's branch becomes the
  constant `work`. Two consumers allow it — the guest's seed, and
  `capsule-provision`'s symref check and push refspec; `capsule-collect` never
  read it (`+refs/heads/*`), so half the problem was never there. An interim
  draft kept an optional profile field for a project that cares what its work is
  called, and **two slices of one project at once refutes that**: if a branch
  name identifies the work it is not project state, and collect already lands
  everything as `refs/capsule/<slot>/*` where whatever names the work outside
  this repo can name it. So L13 closes in the strongest available form — not a
  fifth override, not a defaulted field, no field. Written up in
  [contract-target.md](./contract-target.md), including the separation it turns
  on: `capsule-provision <ref>` is a ref in the *target repo* and is untouched.

## 5. Read from source: where a capsule's identity actually lives

The affordability of everything in §6 rests on three facts about microvm.nix,
read from its own source and from this host's store rather than assumed. Same
move as Plan C's
[host-module question](./plan-c-multi-capsule.md#the-host-module-question-answered-from-source).

**`microvm -c` is ten lines.** In a temp dir: write the flake ref to a file,
`nix build -o current
"$FLAKE"#nixosConfigurations."$NAME".config.microvm.declaredRunner`, `mv` the
dir to `/var/lib/microvms/$NAME`, `chown :kvm -R`, `chmod -R a+rX`, `chmod g+w`,
and two gcroot symlinks — `current` and `booted` — keyed on the *slot's*
directory, not on the attribute. `-u` is the same build in place. So a capsule's
whole binding to a nix artefact is **one symlink in its state directory**, and
the gcroots follow the slot rather than the flavour.

**The machine config is not in the image.** `declaredRunner` is a shell script
plus a ~1 KB JSON:

```json
"machine-config": { "mem_size_mib": 8192, "smt": true, "vcpu_count": 4 },
"drives": [ { "drive_id": "store", "path_on_host": "/nix/store/…-microvm-store-disk.erofs" } ]
```

and the volume's size is a `truncate -s 32768M` in the script, applied only when
the image file does not yet exist (`microvm-run`, lines 13-14 on this host,
right after a `chattr +C` that is a no-op on ext4). So the *hypervisor*
configuration is a kilobyte beside a 3.0 GiB erofs that the runner merely
references — and a volume's declared size is fixed at first boot, so D3's
`resize` is delete and recreate rather than a verb of its own.

**`mem` is runner-only — settled, and it settled less than it was asked to.**
This was the one inferred claim in this file. The check was an eval comparing
`system.build.toplevel.drvPath` with and without a forced `microvm.mem`
(`lib.mkForce`, since `vm/capsule.nix` sets it from `target.sizes.mem` at normal
priority and a bare value conflicts). **Identical paths.** So two capsules
declared at 6144 and 8192 share one erofs, §9 step 3's drop is free of the image,
and a class varying only `mem` costs the ~1 KB of JSON above.

**What that does not settle is `vcpu`, and the eval could not have told you.**
Read from source instead: `vm/capsule.nix` does `inherit (target.sizes) vcpu
mem`; `mem` reaches `microvm.mem` and stops, but `target.nix` renders
`jobs = ${toString sizes.vcpu}` into `guestConfig`'s cargo config, which is a
store file **in the closure**. So for this target a vCPU change is class 2 and a
`microvm -u` per slot. Forcing the *option* `microvm.vcpu` leaves
`target.sizes.vcpu` untouched, so that guest config never moves and the same eval
returns identical paths for a coupling that is real — the probe confirming the
claim it was meant to falsify ([item 27](./ledger/027-a-class-is-not-always-a-kilobyte.md)).

So the rule is narrower than "classes cost a kilobyte": **a class is a kilobyte
only over reservations the assigned profile derives nothing from**, which is a
predicate over a *(class, profile)* pair rather than a global fact. The coupling
itself is the guinea-pig capability working — *render static guest config from
the declared reservation* — not a leak, so the fix is the cost model rather than
the derivation.

**Upstream has a mode for "someone else owns this state directory".** Read from
source: `build()` refuses outright when a `toplevel` symlink is present — *"This
MicroVM is managed fully declaratively and cannot be updated manually"* — and
`microvm -l` reads that same link for its up-to-date comparison. So a program of
ours owning `current` can write `toplevel` too, and upstream's `-u` then refuses
rather than silently rebuilding `nixosConfigurations.<slot>`, which by that
point would be the wrong attribute.

Two things were to be checked before leaning on that, and **both have been read**
([item 49](./ledger/049-who-owns-a-state-directory.md), which is where the detail
lives — a caveat inside a costing section is not a thing anyone tracks, and this
one was a precondition for both D3 and D7):

- what the declarative path writes: four lines, and the units want
  `current/bin/*`, `booted/` and the right ownership and nothing else, so a
  directory of ours owes them nothing further;
- **whether anything reconciles declaratively-managed VMs: nothing does**, at
  this lock. The feared shape — a reconciler finding a marked directory with no
  matching declaration and taking a volume with it — is not there. What is there
  is the mirror image, and it is why the constraint survives the read:
  `install-microvm-<name>` runs on **every rebuild** and re-points `current` at
  the declaration, so the day `~/flakes` declares a `microvm.vms.<slot>` a host
  rebuild silently reverts a composed slot. `toplevel` does not defend against
  that; only the absence of the declaration does, and that is an assertion in
  `capsule-perimeter` now rather than a comment in another repo.

## 6. The shape this suggests

Five nouns, each with one home. The point of the split is that only one of them
is a nix artefact.

| noun | what it is | lives | cost to change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **slot** | index → namespace, uplink /30, socket, units | `capsules.nix` | class 3, once |
| **flavour** | a tool set — the only irreducible per-target closure content | **composed**, not declared: the profile's floor plus the assignment's extras | class 2 to *add a fragment*; a symlink to *re-point* |
| **class** | machine config: mem, vcpu | the runner's JSON | ~1 KB per combination over `mem`; a 3.0 GiB image over `vcpu`, because this profile derives guest config from it (item 27) |
| **source** | where this host keeps the profile's repo | a host declaration, keyed by profile | class 3 — and never an assigner's to set |
| **assignment** | profile, policy, class, extras, base commit, purpose | `/var/lib/capsule/slot/<slot>/assignment.json` | run time, free unless the composition is unbuilt |
| **volume** | checkout, `$HOME`, caches, `target/`, **and its own size** | `/var/lib/microvms/<slot>` | verbs (D3); size fixed at creation |

Seven nouns, not five, and the two extra ones both came out of "target".
**Policy** — allowlist and ingestion bounds — has a different owner from a
project's
semantics and is what
[item 25](./ledger/025-assignment-is-a-perimeter-verb.md) is about. **Source** —
where this host keeps the repo — is not project state either: `/home/…/doctrine`
describes a host, and `path` already half-admits it by carrying two host-side
overrides where no other field has one. It is also the field an assigner must
never spell, since `capsule-provision` reads that repo as the human. Volume
size has come out of `class` on the same principle: §5 read it as a `truncate`
applied only at first boot, so a class carrying it could let an assignment
claim a size its disk was never created with. `class` is `mem` and `vcpu`;
storage is the volume's — and what a *project* needs, as against what a host
grants it, is a reservation rather than a deletion
([contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md)).

The field-by-field version of all of this, and the ownership rule it rests on,
is [contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md); where a flavour's tools
come from and how they compose is
[contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md). Both were written before D1,
deliberately — see §9 step 4 — and both have since been drawn on rather than left
on paper: the assignment contract's ownership split is what D1's record and
[item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)'s policy field are, and
the flavour contract's **composition** half is built (`fragments.nix`,
[item 31](./ledger/031-the-fragment-vocabulary.md)). What is unbuilt in each is
*selection*: an assignment that names a profile, and a per-slot flavour. Both are
D7.

**Only the tool set has to be in the image.** Decomposing what is target-shaped
in the closure today: `toolsPackage` and `extraTools` are genuinely closure
inputs; the checkout directory name, `defaultBranch`, the `caches` environment,
`guestConfig`'s content, the motd, `commands`, `baseline` and `path` are all
*values the seed happens to read from the closure instead of from a file*; and
sizes are in the runner rather than the image, which is §5's one inferred claim
and §9's step 2. So the axis worth naming is not the
target but the **flavour**, and a target becomes host-side run-time state.

Two things a flavour must not inherit from today's single-target shape, both in
[contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md). Its tools **need not come from the
repo being confined** — a shared tool repo serving a class of projects is one
input, one closure and one image for eight repos that export nothing, and
requiring each of them to grow a flake is requiring the wrong repo to change.
And a flavour is **not declared and selected at all — it is composed**, from a
floor the project states and extras the assigner adds, out of a fragment
vocabulary the host declares:

    flavour = compose(profile.floor, assignment.extras)

so the identity is the composition rather than a name someone typed. The extras
are the cross-project half and are expected to be broad and few — `agents`
(`claude`, `pi`, `rg`, `tree`, fileutils, shell) and `dev-facilities` (`neovim`,
`nushell`, `btop`) are the worked pair, wanted by nearly every slot and
therefore costing one image between them. The arithmetic runs the other way for
a fragment only one slot uses: distinct composition, its own 3.0 GiB. Collisions
are a build failure with an explicit `lib.hiPrio` override, which is nix's
answer rather than a new one — a silently shadowed toolchain is what exit 127 in
a guest looks like (NOTES item 23). And a composition nobody has built is a
build, so **whether `assign` may wait for one or must refuse is a per-host
declaration** — the dev/ranch split falling out of §0 again rather than being
chosen here.

That gives both modes from one mechanism, which is what §0 requires:

- **dev host** — a broad vocabulary, and a novel composition builds on demand
  with `assign` waiting for it. In practice nearly every slot lands on the same
  composition, so assignment is fully run time: doctrine can hand slot `d` a
  repo and a sha with no build at all.
- **ranch** — a narrow vocabulary per slot, and an unbuilt composition refused
  rather than built. Assignment is then *guaranteed* cheap, and pre-building the
  allowed compositions is a job upstream. Same mechanism, different declaration.

Changing what a slot runs is then a stop, a `nix build -o current`, and a start
— no `capsules.nix` edit, no host rebuild, no push. Adding a *fragment to the
vocabulary* is a rebuild, which is the right way round: rare and declared versus
frequent and cheap.

Three consequences to accept before any of it is built:

1. **`target.nix` splits into a profile and a policy, one of each per project,
   host-side.** The contract is unchanged — still nothing read *out of* the
   confined repo, still host-side and keyed by name (NOTES item 16) — but it
   becomes two documents with two owners rather than one file with fifteen
   fields (NOTES item 25). The profile is project semantics and is what an
   assigner may name freely; the policy is a control and is selected from a set
   the slot declares.

   **And the run-time interface is a validated document, not a nix file.**
   Authoring in nix and rendering to JSON in a directory is what this host will
   do, because nix is what it has and the profile is checked at build time for
   free. But a program reads the rendered document at run time, so a controller
   that never runs `nixos-rebuild` stays possible — which is the whole point of
   making a target run-time state. `perimeter/egress-allow.txt` is the precedent
   already in the tree: a plain file rather than a store path, for exactly this
   reason.
2. **The seed becomes assignment-driven.** An unassigned slot boots empty with
   no checkout, which is more honest than one hardcoded to doctrine. `capsule
   <slot> assign <target> [ref]` writes the record, pushes it, provisions,
   injects, baselines. The seed's remaining job is the generic part — the
   volume's skeleton and its ownership — and the target-shaped part (checkout
   directory, cache directories, `guestConfig` links) should be done **by the
   host over the channel that already exists**, not by a guest-side applier
   reading a pushed file. Same reasoning as everywhere else here: the host
   initiates, the guest stays dumb, and there is no new guest program to keep in
   step.
3. **The config payload must be refresh-always — but "always" means the pinned
   generation, not the latest document.** `guestConfig` is currently a *symlink
   into the store*, precisely so a stale copy cannot outlive the sizes it was
   rendered from (`vm/capsule.nix`). As a pushed payload it loses that unless
   the host re-pushes at every start — which restores the property and keeps the
   host the source. Payloads are write-if-absent by deliberate decision (NOTES
   item 22); this is a *derived* payload, and the distinction wants a field on
   the declaration rather than a change of policy. The identity payload below
   needs the same field, so it is one extension, not two.

   What the first draft got wrong is *which document* gets re-read. A
   **profile** is pinned at the assignment's generation, so editing a project's
   caches or its baseline does not silently change what a running capsule is
   doing with no verb run against it. A **policy** is live, because a tightening
   has to reach a running capsule without a re-assign. Two owners, two clocks;
   one field on the payload declaration says which
   ([contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md), NOTES item 25).

4. **The four host programs bake the target into their store paths, and this is
   NOTES item 20 one level up.** `host/programs.nix` derives `guestRepo` from
   `target.guestPath`, and hands `baseline` its `command`, `workdir`,
   `recordDir` and `measure` from `target.nix`; `git-channel.nix` takes
   `defaultBranch` and `collectMaxPackBytes` the same way. One target makes that
   invisible. Two targets make it four programs per target — the exact shape of
   the bug that stood between N=1 and N=2, where a socket path baked into a
   store path meant a program per capsule. The fix rhymes too: those values
   arrive at run time from the assignment record, the way `--capsule` already
   does, and one store path goes on serving everything. **This is D7's first
   task, not a detail of it** — and it is worth doing even if flavours never
   happen, because it is the same coupling the repo has already decided against
   once.

   **Scoped, inventoried and planned in
   [item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md)**, which is where it
   is tracked and which carries two things this paragraph does not: the read is
   wider than "the four programs" — `statePaths` and `stateMaxBytes` are
   interpolated into a script that is *pushed into the guest*, so the text is the
   interface — and **detargeting subsumes D7's "checkout at a generic path"
   bullet below**, at none of its cost, since a path arriving at run time is not
   in the closure either while relocating one strands every existing volume's
   checkout. What it does *not* do is get the name out of the guest image; that
   is consequence 2's seed, and so finishing this does not make two targets
   concurrent.

**Identity falls out of the same payload.** A refresh-always `/work/.capsule`,
sourced by the guest's `interactiveShellInit` exactly as `.env` already is, lets
the prompt read `agent@delta:doctrine@a1b2c3`. Per-slot identity, one image,
nothing in the closure — L5 and NOTES item 21 without touching what makes one
image structural. It is not quite free: the sourcing line is a guest change
(class 2, once), and whether a `PS1` set there survives NixOS's own prompt
initialisation depends on ordering in `/etc/bashrc`, which wants checking rather
than assuming — the motd and a login banner are the fallback if it does not.

**The allowlist stays host-side.** Since target is now run time, the proxy
cannot read it from the guest's copy. Q1's answer: bind-mount a *directory* of
allowlists read-only into the proxy's namespace and have it select
`<dir>/<policy>.txt` at start, from the host's assignment record. Re-assigning a
slot is then a proxy restart, and L3 falls out for free.

**But that makes `assign` a perimeter-mutating verb, and the fix is the sixth
noun.** If the *project* names the allowlist, then whoever may hand a slot a
project may hand it a wider perimeter — the exposure is authority rather than
reach, since the guest still cannot see or touch the record. So the assignment
names a **policy** separately from a **profile**, and the set of policies a slot
may take is declared host-side per slot; `assign` selects within it or is
refused. A dev host declaring that set as "any" is §0's permissive mode falling
out of a declaration, which is what §0 requires of every mechanism here. NOTES
item 25, and `collectMaxPackBytes` is on the same side of that line as the
allowlist.

**Where classes must not go.** Class is machine config and belongs in the
runner. A *role* — worker, auditor: which allowlist, whether it may collect,
what it may be assigned — is policy and belongs in the record. A label like
`worker-highcpu-A` is one string over two axes; keep them separate underneath or
the runner starts carrying policy. And the slot id itself stays short: it is on
the wire as `cap-<id>` and IFNAMSIZ is 15, so `capsules.nix` refuses anything
over 11 characters. The id is `a`…`j`; the composite is a rendered label in
status and in the prompt, never a namespace name.

**What stays unavoidable:** one flake input literal per repo whose packages a
flavour composes. An input url cannot be computed (NOTES item 16). The count
follows the number of *tool sources* rather than the number of projects, which
is the point: eight projects on one shared base are one input, and it is the
only place a repo name appears.

## 7. Directions

- **D1 — the assignment record. Built and run** ([status](./status.md),
  [item 29](./ledger/029-the-record-is-front-end-written.md)) — at
  `/var/lib/capsule/slot/<slot>/`, and the field list
  is [contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md)'s rather than this
  file's. Written by `capsule`, read by status, pushed to the guest as identity.
  It is what makes an abstract slot legible, and every other direction here
  either writes to it or reads from it. Four properties that are cheap now and
  expensive to retrofit, so they are part of D1 and not a later tidy:

  - **desired state and observations are separate objects** — otherwise nothing
    can answer *is this slot doing what it was told*;
  - **every reference is a name plus a resolved identity**, and the resolved one
    is what is used: `base.ref`/`base.oid`, the profile name beside the profile
    *bytes*, the fragment names beside the resolved *store path*. A digest is
    verification; **pinning also requires retention**, so the record keeps the
    profile snapshot and a gcroot keeps the image. Otherwise "reapply the pinned
    generation" is really "re-resolve these names and hope";
  - each slot carries a **generation** integer, which is what makes a late
    answer refusable once anything detached exists (D6);
  - the serialization carries a **`schema` discriminator**, even though the
    design is deliberately unversioned — persistent state outlives the binary
    that wrote it, and a number on the bytes promises nothing about the
    contract.
- **D2 — the pool.** Declare `a`…`j` once, and make assignment run-time state.
  Turns S1, S4 and S10 from rebuilds into commands. The cost is not idle
  namespaces — nothing starts at boot, so an unassigned slot is a declaration
  and nothing else — it is L12: on the first start of *any* capsule the guard
  pulled in all ten, and any one of them that would not come up denied the whole
  host. That was L12, and it is closed
  ([item 30](./ledger/030-a-pool-audits-what-exists.md)) — so what is left of D2
  is the declaration and the run-time assignment, with nothing standing in front
  of them. **The declaration has landed and is switched**: `capsules.nix` says
  `a`…`j`, and it costs 3% of a module eval and one page of PID 1 at rest
  ([probes](./probes.md#what-ten-declared-slots-cost)) — so "the cost is not idle
  namespaces" above is now measured rather than argued. **And the run-time half
  has landed too** ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)):
  `policy` is a field an assignment selects from the set its slot declares, which
  closes L3 and S12 as well. **D2 is done**, and what §9 step 8 still pairs it
  with is D7's dynamic half — a *target* as run-time state — which is a different
  field and a different rebuild class.
- **D3 — volume verbs.** `capsule <slot> volume {df,reset,reset-home,clone-from
  <m>}`, host-side, refusing while the VM runs. `reset` is S4 without the `rm
  -rf`; `clone-from` is S5, and on ext4 it is a sparse copy of ~1.1 GiB —
  seconds against doctrine's 109 s, and worth much less on a target whose
  baseline is 3 s (L8). No `resize`: the size is set at first boot (§5). Also
  the guard on a flavour swap: a volume carrying one flavour's caches is silent
  garbage under another, so `assign` refuses a flavour change on a non-clean
  volume and offers `--reset`.
- **D4 — clone semantics, decided rather than inherited.** A cloned volume
  carries the source's ssh host keys, injected credentials and `.env`. Scrub by
  default, `--identity` to keep — dev convenience is one flag, the ranch default
  is the safe one.

  **The rule underneath is a trust boundary, not a cache-compatibility
  problem.** A volume also carries the previous assignment's caches and build
  tree, and under a new project, flavour or policy those are not stale garbage —
  they are *input supplied by a different principal*, and a build that reads
  them is a build the new owner did not specify. So reuse across a change of
  project, flavour or policy ownership is refused on a non-clean volume, with
  `--reset` as the answer, and a dev host may waive that by declaration. Stating
  it this way rather than as "the caches would be useless" is what makes the
  ranch default fall out instead of being argued for twice.

  And clone from a *base* rather than from a worked-in capsule:
  a slot is a valid clone source while it is `baselined` and not yet `dirty`,
  which is Q3's state model — `unassigned → provisioned(sha) → baselined(sha) →
  dirty`. The mechanism belongs here (worktree dirty, `HEAD != base sha`,
  `$HOME` touched since baseline, or an interactive session opened); the
  *policy* about what may be reused is doctrine's.
- **D5 — status answers the steering questions. Built and run**, and built
  *before* D1 because the guest round trip is what settles where `base.oid` comes
  from. Add columns fed by the ssh
  round trip `answers` already pays for: base sha, dirty/ahead, `df /work`, last
  baseline verdict and age, current-versus-peak memory — the last because the
  ratchet means a capsule holds its high-water until stopped, so `stop` is a
  resource verb and a human needs to know which idle slot to reap. Keep the
  existing discipline — no root, bounded, a dead guest is a row and not a hang —
  which argues for one guest-side script returning one line rather than five ssh
  calls per capsule. One caveat on the baseline column: read the *record*, never
  the exit status. The reason is no longer a live bug — item 24's login-shell fix
  has shipped — but it is the same reason: the record on the volume was right
  throughout the period the exit status was wrong, because `capsule-baseline`
  writes it before the shell that runs it can lose the status
  ([status](./status.md), NOTES item 24). That is the property the column should
  inherit, and it does not depend on the bug still existing.
- **D6 — detached agent sessions.** Generalise `host/baseline.nix`'s pattern
  with a pty: a multiplexer in the guest closure and `capsule <slot> attach`.
  What makes N > 2 workable for a human, and independent of everything above.
- **D7 — flavours.** §6's split. A second target *is* real (L1), so what this
  now waits on is wanting two of them **at once**; a switch is already a branch.
  Its first task is §6's consequence 4 — the four programs' target-shaped
  values, of which L13 is the one with no override at all — and nothing above
  forecloses it. That task is
  [item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md) now: inventoried,
  its steps 0 to 2 **built and green** — the five guest-pushed scripts take
  every value they are about on their command line, the two that had no case
  suite have one, and the seven suites are out of `flake.nix` into a file each
  beside what they pin (behaviour-free, and it halved that file) — carrying the three
  decisions the rest of it needs — whether the profile document is per target or
  one for the host, whether it is a store path checked at build or a plain file
  with a validator, and what a fleet-wide status table does with a predicate that
  has become per-target.

  **The four programs are the start of the inventory, not the whole of it.** The
  guest image also knows the project's name, its checkout path, its branch, its
  cache directories, its `guestConfig`, its motd and `commands`, its sizes and
  its tool set — and only the last is irreducibly a flavour's. Three
  generalisations make most of the rest disappear rather than become
  parameters, which is the cheaper move and is worth doing even before flavours:

  - ~~**the checkout goes at a generic path**, not `<volumePath>/<name>`~~ —
    **superseded for the host programs by
    [item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md)**: this bullet
    exists to get a project's name out of the closure, and a path that arrives at
    run time is not in the closure either, while relocating one strands every
    existing volume's checkout. What survives is the second half of the sentence
    — `target.guestPath`'s derivation from `name` is a courtesy, and the display
    name belongs in the identity payload where the prompt already wants it — plus
    the *guest image's* copy of it, which is consequence 2's seed and not this;
  - **caches go at a derived path keyed by the env var**, so `caches` becomes a
    list of names rather than a map to directories. Strictly fewer degrees of
    freedom for the same capability, and `cachePaths` still derives;
  - **run records go beside them under a generic directory**, which is what
    `capsule-baseline`'s `recordDir` already is in spirit — beside the checkout,
    never inside it.

  What is left after that is a tool closure and a handful of values, which is
  what §6 claims and this is the check on the claim.

## 8. Questions a second project will raise

Not answerable from doctrine, and worth asking before the first one arrives:

- **Does it need a service to test against?** A database or a queue must be in
  the guest closure or nowhere ([item 4](./ledger/004-live-postgres.md), open) —
  and the guest closure is this repo's, so a target has no way to declare "run
  postgres". The generic capability would be *target-declared guest services*,
  and it does not exist. Under §6 it would be a property of a flavour.
- **Does it have a flake at all?** `toolsPackage = null` degrades to
  `extraTools` from this repo's nixpkgs and loses the no-drift property — and
  the second target found that for many repos that path is **structurally
  unavailable**, not merely worse: `extraTools` is bare nixpkgs attr names, so a
  tool set containing a `python3.withPackages (…)` has no name to give it. A
  target exports a package or it is not a target; `extraTools` is a supplement,
  never a substitute (NOTES item 23). A non-nix project is still the real test
  of the degraded path — and the answer it wants is not a better absent path but
  a tool set from somewhere other than the project
  ([contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md)), which is the case that makes
  composition load-bearing rather than convenient.
- **What does its dev loop look like from outside?** S9 stops being a nicety for
  anything web-shaped, and doctrine — with `just web-build` — is already that
  shape.
- **How big is its checkout and its build tree?** No reflink, a 32 GiB volume
  declared per slot, and the host's remaining headroom in
  [probes](./probes.md#figures). Disk is the fleet's real ceiling — and the
  spread is wide enough to matter: doctrine's baseline leaves ~1.1 GiB on the
  volume and panopticon's ~105 MiB, a factor of twelve for the same verb.
- **Where do its secrets come from?** `setup.nix` is a host-wide declaration,
  not a per-target one. Two projects with different API keys share one payload
  list.
- **Does it tolerate N concurrent sessions on one credential?** NOTES item 2,
  still open, and the fleet is what makes it literal.
- **Who may assign which repo to which slot?** Trivial on a dev machine, where
  every repo is the human's. On a ranch it is the whole question, and it lands
  on the assignment record — which is the argument for that record being
  host-side and authoritative rather than a convenience. The half of it that is
  answerable now, because it is a design constraint rather than a policy: an
  assigner is free in profile, base and purpose, and confined to a declared set
  in policy, flavour and class (NOTES item 25,
  [contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md)).

## 9. Order of work

**Steps 1–5 are taken and 6–8 are not.** Which is *not* this file's to say — the
present tense is a backlog record's — but the ordering argument only
reads correctly if you know which end of it you are standing at, so each step
below is annotated in place with what closed it, as L12 and L13 are. The three
things this plan named and nothing tracked are in the ledger now:
[48](./ledger/048-a-forwarded-port-is-host-state.md) (L10),
[49](./ledger/049-who-owns-a-state-directory.md) (§5's precondition, **read**, so
step 6 is ungated) and
[50](./ledger/050-a-quarantine-outlives-its-assignment.md) (S10).

1. **§0's local flake input. Taken** — L11. One line at the rebuild, and it takes
   the push out of class 3, which every step below churns.
2. **Settle §5's inference, before anything is built on it. Settled, and it
   settled less than it was asked to** ([item
   27](./ledger/027-a-class-is-not-always-a-kilobyte.md)). The eval was the one
   written out in §5, comparing `toplevel.drvPath` with and without a changed
   `microvm.mem`: identical paths would mean the mem drop below is free of the
   image and a class costs a kilobyte, different paths that the drop is a 3.0 GiB
   rebuild plus `microvm -u` per slot and §6's table is wrong about where `class`
   lives. **Identical** — for `mem`. `vcpu` had to be read from source instead,
   because forcing the *option* leaves `target.sizes.vcpu` untouched and the same
   eval would have returned identical paths for a coupling that is real. It was
   the cheapest step here and the one the two after it depended on.
3. **Rename to slots. Deployed**, and drop `sizes.mem` to 6144 in the same
   breath, since
   both need the same rebuild. The two existing capsules are expendable, so
   recreate rather than migrate — a `mv` of the state directory would also want
   its two gcroot symlinks re-pointed, and the volumes are worth less than the
   care. Take a per-unit `memory.peak` off the first cold build afterwards,
   because §0's arithmetic is the old ceiling's figures reasoned forward — and
   that peak is now taken, and it withdrew the arithmetic rather than confirming
   it (§0, [probes](./probes.md#the-first-cold-build-at-a-6144-ceiling)). What the
   rename actually touches,
   beyond `capsules.nix`:
   - **the devshell path's assumptions.** `vm <name>` resolves a flake
     attribute,
     and `vm-stop` asks the guest to halt only when the name is literally
     `capsule` — one link, one guest, so any other name is reaped rather than
     asked. Both need to follow the rename or the devshell shape quietly becomes
     a power cut.
   - **every `just` recipe's default**, which is the literal string `capsule` in
     fifteen places rather than `capsules.default`. That duplication is invisible
     while the default capsule is named `capsule`, and wrong the moment it is
     not. Thread the value.
   - **`capsules.default` itself**, which stops meaning much once slots are
     abstract: defaulting to slot `a` is a habit, not a choice. Worth deciding
     whether the default becomes "the only running capsule, else refuse" —
     better for a fleet, but it makes a program's target depend on host state,
     which is the kind of thing this repo has refused before (NOTES item 20).
4. **Fix the contracts, before D1 writes a record. Written**, and the ordering
   paid: `policy` is a field an assignment selects rather than one a project
   names, which is the fusion this step existed to prevent and which D2's
   run-time half then built. The artifacts are
   [contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md) and
   [contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md), plus the ownership column in
   [contract-target.md](./contract-target.md). The reason for the ordering is
   narrow and worth stating: a persistent record is the most likely place for
   today's single-target assumptions to survive a transition meant to remove
   them, and the assumption that matters most is the one that fuses a project
   with its perimeter (NOTES item 25). Design cost only — no build, no
   mechanism, and it deliberately stops short of an execution contract, which is
   [contract-doctrine.md](./contract-doctrine.md) Role 3's to say why.
5. **D1 + D5, the record and the columns. Built and run** ([item
   29](./ledger/029-the-record-is-front-end-written.md), and D5 closed L6).
   Cheapest useful pair, and a fleet has to be legible before it can be
   administered — which it now is, and which is why the sideband arc (items
   32–35, 42, 45, 47) could be built on top of a record rather than beside one.
6. **D3 + D4, volume verbs and clone semantics.** S4 and S5 are the two most
   frequent administrative actions and one of them is currently a hand-typed
   `rm -rf`. ~~Gated on [item
   49](./ledger/049-who-owns-a-state-directory.md)~~ — **ungated**: both reads
   are taken, nothing reconciles, and a directory of ours owes the units
   `current/bin/*`, `booted/` and its ownership and nothing else. What the read
   leaves behind is a standing constraint rather than a gate — `~/flakes`
   declares no `microvm.vms`, and that line is now load-bearing for a second
   reason.
7. **D6, detached sessions.** When N > 2 stops being a probe and starts being a
   Tuesday. Independent of everything above, and it carries two other things:
   L9, and the *is an agent running* column L6 could not close. It is also
   [item 46](./ledger/046-bash-until-the-record-stops-being-flat.md)'s nearest
   trigger, since `generation`'s refusal half turns a whole-file write into a
   read-compare-write.
8. **D7 + D2's dynamic half, flavours and targets as data.** Once two projects
   are wanted **at once** — one at a time already works, and the port cost is a
   diff rather than an argument (L1, NOTES item 23). It starts with the four
   programs' target-shaped values (§6.4), which are
   [item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md) — inventoried and
   planned, and the one part of step 8 that needs no second target to be worth
   building — ~~and L13~~, **whose half of the
   precondition is met**: no program spells the branch any more. §6.4 is the
   remaining half, and it is worth doing even if flavours never happen, because
   it is [item 20](./ledger/020-which-capsule-a-program-means.md)'s coupling one
   level up — a value baked into a store path that should arrive at run time —
   and this repo has already decided against that shape once.
