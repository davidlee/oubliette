# Contract — what a repo must be to be confined

The capsule is the product and the repo it confines is a client, so the
integration surface is worth stating as a contract rather than discovering it
per target. This file is that surface, field by field, in both directions: what
a target must supply, and what it may rely on the capsule to provide.

The *rule* that produced this shape is in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) ("doctrine
is the guinea pig, not the design") and the history is
[item 16](./ledger/016-target-agnostic.md). Neither is restated here. How far
any of it has been exercised is `doctrine backlog list`'s to say — `RSK-002` is
the three absent paths, `IMP-004` the second target that would run them; this file
describes the interface, not its state. Usage — the commands in order, with a
live target — is [README.md](../README.md).

doctrine is one instance of this contract, and the other half of *its*
relationship with this repo is [contract-doctrine.md](./contract-doctrine.md).

Two sibling contracts cover what happens once there is more than one of
anything, and neither is built:
[contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md) is where a guest's capabilities and
tool closure come from, and
[contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md) is what a slot is assigned
and who may say so. This file describes today's single-target shape; where each
of its fields is headed is the `owner` column below.

## The floor

*Be a git repo on this host, and expose one flake package for this system that
is your devshell's tool set.* Everything else is a `target.nix` field with a
working absent path, and every one of those fields is **host-side** — nothing is
ever read out of the target repo, because the agent can edit that.

**Stated plainly, because hedging it would mislead: the supported set is
nix-integrated projects.** A target exports a package or it is not a target —
`toolsPackage = null` plus `extraTools` is bare nixpkgs attr names, so a tool
set assembled by a function has no name to give and the absent path is
*structurally* unavailable rather than merely worse
([item 23](./ledger/023-second-target.md)). That is a defensible contract and
this repo commits to it as the current one. Where it is headed is
[contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md): what a target owes is a *floor* —
the fragments it cannot be built or tested without — and exporting a package
your devshell shares becomes the convenient way to supply one rather than the
only way. A floor may be a single reference to a shared base and nothing else,
which is what makes a repo with no flake at all confinable.

Two literals are unavoidable and nothing checks that they agree:

- `inputs.target.url` in `flake.nix` — an input's url cannot be computed.
- `path` in `target.nix` — where `capsule-provision` pushes from.

Switching targets means editing both, or `--override-input target path:/…` for
one build. Renaming the *input* is not free downstream either: the host's own
config (`~/flakes`) carries `inputs.target.follows`, and its next lock fails on
an input that no longer exists.

## Configuration — `target.nix`

`rec`, so the guest paths derive from `name` and `volumePath` rather than being
spelled on both sides.

The `owner` column is an **analysis of what is already here**, not a planned
change: it says which authority each field answers to, and it is the reason a
single file holding all of them is a coupling rather than a convenience.
`profile` is project semantics, `flavour` is the tool closure, `class` is the
machine reservation, `policy` is a host control, `source` is where this host
keeps the repo, and `capsule` marks a field that is not target-shaped at all.
Where each is headed is
[contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md) and
[contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md); nothing about today's shape
changes until they are built.

| field | owner | read by | required | absent path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | profile | guest (checkout dir, motd), host (`services.capsule-perimeter.repo` default). **It is also the document's filename**, so it is the name every host-side program is given as `--profile` | yes | — |
| `path` | **source** | host: `capsule-provision` looks it up (its push source), `capsule-brief --from-host` (the checkout it snapshots), `capsule <slot> fetch` (the repo a quarantine lands in) | yes | `CAPSULE_REPO`, or the module's `repo` option, overrides it per host — and having two host-side overrides where no other field has any is the tell that it was never project state |
| `volumePath` | capsule | guest: the mount point, and what `caches`/`guestConfig` resolve against. host: `capsule status` looks it up for the disk figure and for `<volumePath>/baseline`, which is where `capsule-baseline` writes its record. **Must match `^/[A-Za-z0-9._/@+-]+$`** — absolute, and nothing a shell reads as anything but a path. It is spliced unquoted into `capsule-reset-home`'s `rm` as root (`vm/guest-path.nix`), so a value carrying a space or a glob character would word-split into paths nobody named; a value that does not match throws at guest eval rather than building | yes | — |
| `guestPath` | capsule | guest: the checkout the seed creates. host: looked up by all five programs — it is the path half of the guest's git URL and the working directory of every script pushed into a capsule | derived | — |
| `toolsPackage` | flavour | guest: `packages.<system>.<name>` from the target's own flake | in practice yes | `null` — the guest gets `extraTools` only, and loses the no-drift property that made threading the target's list worth it. **Available only to a target whose whole tool set is a list of nixpkgs attr names**: `extraTools` is a supplement, never a substitute, so anything built by a function — a `python3.withPackages (…)` has no attr name — has to export a package (NOTES item 23) |
| `extraTools` | flavour | guest: nixpkgs attr names, resolved against the *guest's* pkgs | no | `[]` |
| ~~`allowlist`~~ | — | — | **no such field** | deleted, and nothing replaces it: what a capsule may talk to is a host policy selected per slot from a declared set, never named by the project in it ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)) — see below |
| `caches` | profile | guest: env var → directory under the volume, and the dirs the seed creates and chowns | no | `{}` — everything then writes wherever its tool defaults, which for a RAM-backed root means guest RAM |
| `cachePaths` | capsule | guest seed (build time); host: `capsule-baseline` looks them up for its before/after sizing | derived | — |
| ~~`defaultBranch`~~ | — | — | **no such field** | deleted, and nothing replaces it: the guest's branch is the constant `work`, spelled once in `flake.nix` and threaded to its two consumers — see below |
| ~~`collectMaxPackBytes`~~ | — | — | **no such field** | deleted with `allowlist` and for its reason: how much may come back out of a capsule is host policy about ingestion. It and `mayCollect` are a policy's, and `capsule-collect` resolves them from `--policy <name>` ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)) |
| `statePaths` | **policy** | guest: what `capsule-collect` snapshots into a sideband commit beside the code refs (NOTES item 32). A **template** list — each entry may hold one `{unit}`, filled at collect from the assignment. Also what gates `capsule-adopt`, the validating extractor at the far end ([item 34](./ledger/034-adopting-a-guest-authored-tree.md)), and `capsule-brief`, which puts one capsule's snapshot into another's checkout ([item 35](./ledger/035-briefing-a-capsule-with-state.md)). **And host-side, at `path`**: `capsule-brief --from-host` reads the same templates in *your* checkout, for a unit no capsule has driven yet ([item 42](./ledger/042-a-state-half-no-capsule-has-held.md)) — so these paths are now read on both sides of the door, and what travels from the host is these paths and nothing else | no | `[]` — the collect is the code-only program it was before item 32, and there is no state ref for an extractor to read. Decided by the *document* since item 51 step 6, so a host confining two projects gets each answer: `--unit` is then refused rather than absent, and `capsule-adopt`/`capsule-brief` exist and say what they have nothing to do |
| `stateMaxBytes` | **policy** | guest: the ceiling on one such snapshot, checked before the commit is made — looked up by `capsule-collect` and `capsule-brief --from-host`, which put it on that script's command line | with `statePaths` | — (required once `statePaths` is non-empty; the pair is the unit that may be omitted, not either half) |
| `commands` | profile | guest: the motd's line about the target's own entrypoints | no | `""` |
| `baseline` | profile | host: `capsule-baseline` looks up the command it runs in the checkout | no | `null` — `capsule-baseline` exists anyway and refuses, naming the profile. It used to not be *built*, which is a better absent path only while a host has one target (item 51 step 6); `capsule <slot> setup` skips the step rather than failing on it |
| `refresh` | profile | host: `capsule-provision` looks up the command it runs in the checkout after the push, and `capsule-refresh` runs the same one on demand. **It is run with stdin closed and must not need it** — the script carrying it arrives on the guest shell's own stdin, so a command that reads stdin reads the rest of that script ([item 47](./ledger/047-a-script-on-stdin-and-the-command-that-eats-it.md)). May write tracked files; its tracked output is committed in the guest, and only onto a tree that was clean before it ran ([item 33](./ledger/033-provision-is-a-sequence.md)) — which is also why a target that writes tracked files here can only be briefed *during* a provision, never after one | no | `null` — as `baseline`: the program exists and refuses by name, and a provision is then the two steps it was before, decided per document rather than per build |
| `sizes` | class (`vcpu`, `mem`) / volume (`volume`) | guest: `vcpu`, `mem`, `volume`; and whatever `guestConfig` derives from them. host: `capsule <slot> provision` looks up `vcpu` and `mem` for the assignment record's `class` | yes | — |
| `guestConfig` | profile | guest: path-under-the-volume → file content, rendered into the closure and linked on by the seed | no | `{}` |

**Half of that table is a document, and the boundary has moved.**
`host/profile.nix` renders `name`, `path`, `guestPath`, `volumePath`,
`cachePaths`, `baseline`, `refresh`, `statePaths`, `stateMaxBytes` and `sizes` to
`<name>.json` — the **run-time half**, meaning the fields a host-side program
needs *after* it has resolved which capsule it means. The other five
(`toolsPackage`, `extraTools`, `caches`, `commands`, `guestConfig`) are inputs to
the guest image and stay build-time, because a document naming them would
describe an image the running slot may not be. The document's keys are the field
names above, deliberately: a renamed key would be a second vocabulary.

**Every host-side program reads those ten fields at run time**
([item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md) step 4), so the
`read by` column above says *which program looks a field up* and no longer *which
store path carries it*: `capsule-provision`, `capsule-collect`,
`capsule-baseline`, `capsule-refresh`, `capsule-brief` and the `capsule` front
end each load one document and index into it. The consequence for a second target
is the whole point — it is a document beside this one, not a rebuild of six
programs.

**Which document is an argument, and there is no default.** A program takes
`--profile <name>` (or `CAPSULE_PROFILE`) and refuses without one, exactly as it
takes `--capsule` ([item 28](./ledger/028-a-slot-has-no-default.md)). The name is
resolved by the *front end*, which is the only thing here allowed to read host
state: an explicit `--profile` wins, then the slot's assignment record `profile`
field, then — for a slot nothing has assigned — the one profile this host has
rendered, refusing when there are none or several. A target's name therefore
appears in a program's text nowhere at all.

The render also adds a set of checks that were nowhere before — `guestPath` must
stay derived from `volumePath` and `name`, a cache must live under the volume, a
state template must be relative, hole-free-or-single-holed and paired with a
ceiling, and no value may carry a newline. Those are conditions this table
already stated in prose and nothing enforced.

**And since step 6, no field of this table is read at *build* time by the host at
all.** Three were: `statePaths` decided whether `capsule-collect` had a `--unit`
flag, and `baseline`/`refresh` decided whether their programs were built. Every
`capsule-<verb>` program now exists on every host and refuses at run time for a
document that declares nothing, naming the profile — because "no program rather
than one that cannot work" is the right absent path for a host with one target
and the wrong one for a host with two. The same goes for what the front end
*prints*: `capsule <slot> unit` is always a verb and `capsule all status` always
has a `unit` column, since one table over N slots and M targets can have no
per-target shape (item 51, decision 3). A *program* holds exactly one profile and
does branch on it, which is why `capsule-collect --unit` has two refusals and
`capsule-brief`'s usage line has two shapes.

**And the document is no longer a store path**
([item 52](./ledger/052-the-document-leaves-the-store.md)). It is installed into
`/var/lib/capsule-profiles` at activation, so a second target is **a file in a
directory** rather than a rebuild — and a producer that is not nix can put one
there, which is what making a target run-time state was for. Two consequences a
target's author should know. Every rule about a document is checked **when it is
read**, by the same validator on every path, so a hand-written document gets the
same refusals a rendered one does — `capsule-profile-check <file>` is that
validator as a program, and is what to run before dropping a document in. And a
document under a name this host renders from `target.nix` is **overwritten at
every activation**: `target.nix` is the source and the file is a render, so an
edit in place is reverted.

**What has *not* moved, and it is the honest limit.** The guest **image** still
knows the project's name — the seed builds the checkout directory from the
build-time half — so a second target on one host is still a second image
([Plan D](./plan-d-fleet.md) §6.2). What has stopped being a rebuild apart is
everything host-side.

**Two of those rows are struck out, and that is what the column was for.**
`allowlist` and `collectMaxPackBytes` were host controls — what a capsule may
talk to, and how much may come back — sitting in the same file as `commands` and
a motd string. Harmless while a target was a build-time literal and one host had
one allowlist; an authority hole the moment assigning a project is a run-time
verb, because the project would then be naming its own perimeter
([item 25](./ledger/025-assignment-is-a-perimeter-verb.md)). They are
`policies.nix`'s now, with `mayCollect` beside them, and a slot declares which
policies an assigner may select within
([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)).

**`statePaths` is the one that stayed, and it is the sharpest of the three** —
the one that names *files*: an allowlist of paths read out of a guest's worktree
with `.gitignore` deliberately bypassed, and therefore a list to keep short and
to read as a control rather than as configuration
([item 32](./ledger/032-the-sideband-channel.md)). It stayed because what a
target keeps out of its commits is genuinely the target's to declare; what may
be *ingested* from it is not, which is the line the two struck rows crossed.

**`statePaths` is a template, and that is item 25's split applied inside one
field.** An exhibit has a scope — *the out-of-band state of the work the capsule
was assigned, and none that is not* — and a path list cannot state one, because
the unit of work is run-time state and this file is a build-time literal.
Unscoped is what doctrine's were, and it cost 1886 entries where 41 named the
work. So the **policy** declares where the unit goes, as one `{unit}` per path,
and the **assignment** says which unit, as an opaque token bounded to
`[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` and not `.` or `..`: it may name an instance and may never
widen a perimeter. A template with a hole and no unit **refuses**
([item 28](./ledger/028-a-slot-has-no-default.md)) — the unscoped list is the
failure being fixed, so it is the worst possible default. A target whose
out-of-band state is not per-unit writes no hole and nothing changes for it. The
capability is *a policy path allowlist may be parameterised by one identifier
the assignment carries*; the value is the target's template, and a second target
is a different template and a different token rather than different code.

**And `path` is a third, quieter one.** `/home/david/dev/doctrine` says where
*this host* keeps a checkout; it says nothing about the project, and the
difference shows up the moment there is a second host, a second checkout, or a
controller working from its own clone. It becomes a host-held `profile → source`
binding rather than a profile field
([contract-assignment.md](./contract-assignment.md)) — and, more sharply, one an
assigner may never spell: `capsule-provision` reads that repo **as the human**
([item 11](./ledger/011-host-side-runs-as-you.md)), so a freely-named path is a
local-repository read primitive with a delivery mechanism attached.

**And `defaultBranch` is deleted outright — decided, and now done.** Nothing
replaces it. The guest's branch is the constant `work`, a capsule constant
beside the volume's mount point, and no contract has a field for it. It lives as
`workBranch` in `flake.nix`, which is the wiring layer rather than a fourth
value file: it is not addressing (`net.nix`), not a slot's (`capsules.nix`) and
emphatically not the target's, and its two consumers — the guest's seed and
`capsule-provision` — are both already fed from there.

The first draft of this decision kept an optional `workBranch` on the profile,
on the reasoning that a project might care what its work is called. That is
wrong by one altitude, and the test that shows it is two slices of one project
at once: if a branch name identifies *the work*, it is not a property of the
project, and every capsule on that profile would want a different one. It is not
assignment state either — `capsule-collect` already lands everything as
`refs/capsule/<slot>/*`, so whatever names a piece of work outside this repo can
name it there, at the point where it means something. A capsule needs a base
commit and somewhere local to land commits; it needs neither the target's
canonical branch nor a name for what it is doing.

The mechanics allow it outright. There are exactly two consumers — the guest's
seed (`git init --initial-branch`, `init.defaultBranch`) and `capsule-provision`
(the advertised-symref check, and the push refspec). `capsule-collect` fetches
`+refs/heads/*:refs/capsule/<name>/*` and never reads the field at all, so it is
already branch-agnostic. Both remaining consumers need *a* name and neither
needs *that* name; the symref check is about the seed and the pusher agreeing,
which one shared constant satisfies exactly as well as one shared field.

The two things called "branch" separate cleanly on the way past.
`capsule-provision <ref>` is a ref **in the target repo on this host** — that is
unaffected, still required and still deliberately undefaulted, and it survives
on the assignment as `base.ref` provenance beside the commit it resolved to. The
guest's branch is the other one, and it is the one going.

L13 closes by subtraction, in the strongest form available: the field with no
run-time override does not get one, and does not become a defaulted field
either. It stops existing.

`extraTools = []` is the absent path a second target exercised (NOTES item 23),
and `toolsPackage = null` is the one that turned out to be **narrower than it
looks** — see its row. Still unexercised: `baseline = null`, `refresh = null`,
`caches = {}`, `guestConfig = {}`. Those are absent paths by construction — read
the consumers, not this table, before relying on one.

### What is deliberately not a target field

- **The allowlist file is host-side, and keyed by *policy* rather than by
  target.** The tempting version — a `.capsule/egress-allow.txt` in the repo
  being worked on — hands the allowlist to the thing being confined. Not
  directly, since the host reads the human's working tree, but one careless merge
  of collected work and the agent has widened its own egress. Same for `sizes`
  and `guestConfig`. Keyed by target was the *second* version, and it is gone
  too: it made the authority to say which project a slot holds into the authority
  to say what it may talk to ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)).
- **Only the tool set comes from the target**, because it is a build input
  rather than a control. Keep that asymmetry explicit or the perimeter argument
  leaks.
- **`setup.nix` is not target-shaped at all.** Which agent you sign in as is a
  property of you, not of the repo under confinement, so a second target takes
  that list unchanged. Empty is a working value: a capsule with no injections is
  one you log into by hand.

## What the capsule supplies back

A target may rely on all of this. It is `vm/capsule.nix` plus the seed, and it
is the same for every target.

| | what |
| --- | --- |
| checkout | `guestPath`, a git repo, **initially empty** — history arrives by `capsule-provision`, so the base commit is an argument and not a value in the closure |
| `$HOME` | `<volumePath>/home`, on the volume, so agent state survives reboots and dies with a fresh capsule — and a sibling of the checkout, not a parent of it, which is what lets `capsule <slot> volume reset-home` delete `$HOME` alone and leave `guestPath`, the caches and `<volumePath>/baseline` where they are |
| `TMPDIR` | `<volumePath>/tmp`, mode 1777 — on disk, because the guest's root is tmpfs and therefore guest RAM |
| caches | one env var per `caches` entry, pointing at a directory the seed has created and chowned |
| egress | `HTTP(S)_PROXY`/`http(s)_proxy` at the host's allowlist proxy, `NO_PROXY` for the host and loopback. No default route and no resolver in the guest |
| tools | `git`, plus `compose(floor, extras)`: the floor is this repo's — `toolsPackage` + `extraTools` — and the extras are the host operator's, from `fragments.nix`'s vocabulary (`agents`, `dev-facilities`). A target names no convenience and may rely on none ([contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md), [item 31](./ledger/031-the-fragment-vocabulary.md)) |
| git | `user.name`/`user.email` set, `init.defaultBranch` = the constant `work`, and `receive.denyCurrentBranch = updateInstead` so a provision checks out rather than moving a ref |
| static config | every `guestConfig` entry symlinked onto the volume from the closure — a link, so a rebuild replaces it and a fresh capsule cannot start with a stale copy |
| secrets | `<volumePath>/.env`, sourced at login, persisting on the volume — and pushed there at `capsule <name> start` if this host declares a source for it (`setup.nix`, which is not the target's) |
| foreign binaries | a loader for generic-linux dynamically linked executables (nix-ld), so a toolchain that *downloads* a prebuilt binary — a pypi wheel's, an npm package's, a Go module's vendored one — can run it. NixOS ships no `/lib64` loader, and without this the failure is `Could not start dynamically linked executable`, one second into an otherwise healthy run |
| user | `agent`, uid 1000, no sudo and no su; root reachable by key from the host only |

Four limits shape what a `baseline` — or any command run in the guest — can be.
**They are not the same kind of thing, and a target should not come to depend on
the second kind.** An *invariant* is what the confinement claims and will keep
claiming under a different backend; a *current floor* is what this hypervisor
happens to impose, and a seatbelt or VM-based shape
([plan-b-other-jails.md](./plan-b-other-jails.md)) could lift it without any of
the claims changing.

Invariants — these hold whatever runs underneath:

- **No host directory can ever be mounted in.** No shares, no passthrough
  (`doctrine memory show mem.fact.oubliette.firecracker-constraints`). Anything that must get in arrives over
  the link or is in the closure. Firecracker enforces it; the confinement would
  assert it anyway, since a shared directory is a channel the perimeter does not
  mediate.
- **There is no route out except the proxy**, and therefore no host service
  reachable by address. A target whose tests want a database gets it inside the
  guest closure or not at all ([item 4](./ledger/004-live-postgres.md) is this
  gap, open and unhit). What is *not* invariant is that the database cannot be
  in the closure — that is a missing capability, and
  [contract-flavour.md](./contract-flavour.md) is where it would land.

Current floor — true today, and true because of firecracker plus this guest's
construction rather than because of anything the confinement promises:

- **`nix` does not work in the guest.** The store is a generated read-only
  image; a working `nix` needs `writableStoreOverlay` plus its own volume. A
  baseline that shells out to nix cannot pass. This is a construction choice
  with a known price, not a claim.
- **`environment.variables` is login-shell scope.** Anything the target runs as
  a guest unit needs its own environment; `capsule-baseline`'s `bash -l` exists
  for exactly this reason
  ([item 6](./ledger/006-proxy-env-login-shell-scope.md)). NixOS's, not the
  capsule's.

## Commands and arguments at the boundary

Everything crossing the boundary is host-initiated, runs as the human, and takes
the capsule as an argument rather than being built per capsule
([item 20](./ledger/020-which-capsule-a-program-means.md)) — **and, since
[item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md) step 4, the target as
an argument too, for the same reason one axis over**. Both refuse without one and
neither has a default. In practice a human types neither: `capsule <slot> <verb>`
fills both in from this host's declaration and the slot's record.

| command | arguments | touches the target repo? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capsule-provision` | `[--capsule <name>] --profile <name> <ref> [--force] [--state <capsule>[:<stage>] \| --state-from-host [--stage <name>] [--unit <token>]]` — any commit-ish in `path` | yes: reads it, as you. The only program that does. A provision is a three-step sequence: push, then the state half if either origin is named — `--state` from a capsule's quarantine ([item 35](./ledger/035-briefing-a-capsule-with-state.md)) or `--state-from-host` from this checkout ([items 42](./ledger/042-a-state-half-no-capsule-has-held.md), [47](./ledger/047-a-script-on-stdin-and-the-command-that-eats-it.md)) — then `refresh` in the guest when the target declares one ([item 33](./ledger/033-provision-is-a-sequence.md)). It is not finished when the push lands, and step (2) is *inside* it because a refresh that writes tracked files leaves no moment afterwards when a brief can land |
| `capsule-collect` | `[--capsule <name>] --profile <name> --policy <name> [--stage <name>] [--unit <token>]` | no: fetches into a host-authored quarantine named for the capsule. It does write *in the guest* when the target declares `statePaths` — one ref under `refs/capsule/state/`, never the agent's index, worktree or branches ([item 32](./ledger/032-the-sideband-channel.md)). `--unit` fills the hole in those paths and is **required** when they have one; `capsule <slot> collect` supplies it from the record |
| `capsule-inject` | `[--capsule <name>] [payload...] [--force]` | no: `setup.nix`'s payloads |
| `capsule-baseline` | `[--capsule <name>] --profile <name> [--detach]` | no: runs `baseline` in the guest's checkout |
| `capsule-refresh` | `[--capsule <name>] --profile <name>` | no: runs `refresh` in the guest's checkout. The same step `capsule-provision` takes itself — separate for a hand checkout in the guest, and for retrying the half that failed. It does **commit in the guest** when the refresh writes tracked files, and only onto a tree that was clean before it ran ([item 33](./ledger/033-provision-is-a-sequence.md)) |
| `capsule-adopt` | `[--capsule <name>] [--stage <name>] <dir>` or `--list` | no, and it does not touch the *capsule* either — the first program here with no transport. Reads the quarantine, validates a guest-authored tree (symlink targets, gitlinks, paths), lays it out with git's own writer into a directory that must be empty or absent ([item 34](./ledger/034-adopting-a-guest-authored-tree.md)) |
| `capsule-brief` | `[--capsule <name>] --profile <name> <source>[:<stage>]`, or `--from-host [--stage <name>] [--unit <token>]` | **either**. From a capsule: no — it reads *another* capsule's quarantine and pushes that state commit into this one's checkout, so a second agent can read the first's working state. From `--from-host`: **yes, it reads `path`, as you** — the second program to do so, for a unit whose out-of-band state has never been inside a capsule ([item 42](./ledger/042-a-state-half-no-capsule-has-held.md)). It writes one ref there and drops it again, keeping no archive; a source that is not a declared slot is refused, because a quarantine is what a capsule sent back. Validated host-side by the same check `capsule-adopt` runs either way, and refused guest-side unless the capsule is at the state's `code-oid` ([item 35](./ledger/035-briefing-a-capsule-with-state.md)) |

`<ref>` is required, and there is nothing left it could be defaulted to: it is
a ref in the *target repo*, and `work` is the guest's branch, which is the whole
separation the deleted field turned on. A capsule's base commit is the one thing
it is pinned to, and it should be stated at every provision.

Environment, in the order a program consults it:

| variable | what |
| --- | --- |
| `CAPSULE_NAME` | which capsule, when `--capsule` is not given. There is no default — `capsules.default` was deleted ([item 28](./ledger/028-a-slot-has-no-default.md)) and a program refuses without a name |
| `CAPSULE_PROFILE` | which target, when `--profile` is not given. No default, for `CAPSULE_NAME`'s reason and one sharper: on a host with two documents a fallback would run a verb against the wrong project's paths and report success ([item 51](./ledger/051-the-target-in-four-store-paths.md), decision 4) |
| `CAPSULE_PROFILE_DIR` | which directory holds the documents. The module's copies are wrapped with `/var/lib/capsule-profiles`, where the activation installs them ([item 52](./ledger/052-the-document-leaves-the-store.md)); the devshell's baked default is this host's own render, so that path needs no environment either. One function looks in one place, which is why the switch out of the store cost a default and not a caller |
| `CAPSULE_REPO` | overrides the profile's `path` for `capsule-provision` and `capsule <slot> fetch`. It still wins: what the lookup replaced is the *baked default*, not the environment |
| `CAPSULE_ROOT` | this checkout, for resolving a policy's allowlist file and the default state directory |
| `CAPSULE_STATE` | where quarantines live — `/var/lib/capsule` on the module path, `$CAPSULE_ROOT/.vm/host` otherwise. Written by `capsule-collect`, read by `capsule-adopt` and `capsule-brief`; one definition, `host/quarantine.nix` |
| `CAPSULE_ALLOWLIST` | the allowlist file the proxy serves. **Required, with no fallback** — a proxy that picks one because none was named is the fleet-wide default this repo stopped having. The devshell path fills it from `capsule-host --policy <name>`, the module path from a per-slot symlink ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)) |

The guest initiates nothing. It has no remote and no route to one, so what used
to be a ref restriction is now the absence of a channel
([item 18](./ledger/018-git-channel-direction.md)). Work leaves as commits,
through `capsule-collect`, into a quarantine repo — including any change the
agent made to files the target treats as its own records.

## Porting to a second target

**Done once, so the price is a diff rather than an argument.** panopticon is the
second target, on branch `second-target` — its cold `just check` is green
through a brand-new allowlist ([item 23](./ledger/023-second-target.md),
[probes](./probes.md#the-cold-build-on-a-second-target)). What that port changed
outside this file: one allowlist file, `inputs.target.url`, and **one guest
capability** — `programs.nix-ld`, because a pypi wheel, an npm prebuild and a Go
module's vendored helper all need a `/lib64` loader and none of them supplies a
different one. Nothing else generic moved. In order:

1. `inputs.target.url` in `flake.nix`, and `path` in `target.nix` — the two
   literals above. Check `~/flakes` if you renamed the input.
2. `name`, `commands`, `baseline`, and `refresh` if the target derives anything
   from its checkout that a commit does not carry. Not a branch: there is no such
   field, and the guest's is the constant `work` whatever the target calls its
   own.
3. Usually its own **policy** in `policies.nix`, whose allowlist file is a new
   file rather than an edit to doctrine's — half of any such list is that
   target's dependency hosts. It is not a `target.nix` field any more, and the
   slots that may take it name it in their declared set
   ([item 36](./ledger/036-a-policy-is-selected-not-named.md)).
4. `toolsPackage`. `null` plus a filled-out `extraTools` is the absent path on
   paper and is unavailable to most targets in practice — attr names only, so a
   tool set assembled by a function has to become an exported package in the
   *target*, which is where the contract says that cost belongs.
5. `sizes`, and `guestConfig` derived from them — not copied from a human's
   machine, which describes a machine the capsule is not.
6. `caches` for its toolchain, `{}` if it has none.

The likely friction is all in the last three: `extraTools`, `caches` and `sizes`
are doctrine's toolchain wearing a general name — panopticon took half the
memory and a quarter of the volume, which is what inheriting them would have got
wrong. The review question, every time, is CLAUDE.md's: *would a different
target need this code changed, or only a different value?*

Concurrent capsules on *different* targets is a much larger job than a different
one — a different tool set is a different guest image, which is exactly the
sharing the one-image design buys — and it is priced in
[plan-c-multi-capsule.md](./plan-c-multi-capsule.md), not here.
